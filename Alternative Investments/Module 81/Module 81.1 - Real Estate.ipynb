    "Real estate can provide income in the form of rent, as well as the potential for price appreciation. Investment in real estate can be made directly in properties or indirectly through limited partnerships and publicly traded securities. The types of real estate we will discuss here include single-family residential and commercial. The four largest subcategories of commercial real estate are office buildings, shopping, industrial/warehouse/distribution, and rental residential (single-family detached and multifamily apartment).\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in  **Basic Forms of Real Estate Investments$^1$**, real estate investment can be described in terms of a quadrant. In the first (vertical) dimension, investment is differentiated between public and private real estate.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the private market, ownership usually involves direct investment, such as purchasing property or lending money to a purchaser. Direct investments can be solely owned or indirectly owned through partnerships, where the general partner (GP) provides property management services and limited partners (LPs) are investors (e.g., pension plans).\n",
    "* The public market does not involve direct investment. Rather, ownership involves securities that serve as claims on the underlying assets. Public real estate investment includes ownership of real estate investment trust (REIT) shares, equity in a real estate company, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), residential mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBSs), mortgage REITs, and mortgage ETFs.\n",

    "* An equity investor has an ownership interest in real estate or securities of an entity that owns real estate. Equity investors control decisions such as borrowing money, property management, and the exit strategy.\n",
    "* A debt investor is a lender that owns a mortgage or mortgage-backed securities. A mortgage is collateralized (secured) by the underlying real estate. The lender has a higher priority claim than an equity investor in the event of default. Because the lender must be repaid first, the value of an equity investor's interest is equal to the value of the property less the value of outstanding debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the basic forms has its own risk, expected returns, regulations, legal issues, and market structure. Private real estate investments are usually larger than public investments because real estate is indivisible and illiquid. With public real estate investments, the investors can divide ownership without having to divide the property. As a result, public real estate investments are liquid and enable investors to diversify by participating in more properties.\n",

    "Private real estate investment requires property management expertise on the part of the owner. In the case of publicly traded securities or private limited partnerships, the real estate is professionally managed."

    "\n",
    "One way to invest in infrastructure is to construct the assets and either sell or lease them to the government or operate them directly. Alternatively, an investor might buy existing assets from a government to lease back or operate. Infrastructure investments can also be made by a **public-private partnership**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cash flows generated from infrastructure investments include **availability payments** for making the infrastructure available, **usage-based payments** such as highway tolls, and **take-or-pay arrangements** that require the buyer to pay minimum purchase price for an agreed-upon volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investments in infrastructure assets that are already constructed are referred to as **brownfield investments**, and investments in infrastructure assets that are to be constructed are referred to as **greenfield investments**. An example of a brownfield investment is the privatization of public assets, which may require additional improvements or involve a sale-leaseback arrangement whereby the asset is purchased from and leased back to the government. Brownfield investments in fully operational facilities are called **secondary-stage investments**. Greenfield investments typically follow the build-operate-transfer (BOT) life cycle.\n",

    "Infrastructure assets typically have a long life and are quite large in cost and scale, so direct investment in them has low liquidity. However, more liquid investments backed by infrastructure assets are available through ETFs, mutual funds, private equity funds, or master limited partnerships (MLPs). Publicly traded vehicles for investing in infrastructure are a small part of the overall universe of infrastructure investments and are relatively concentrated in a few categories of assets.

    "In general, investing in brownfield investments provides stable cash flows and relatively high current yields, but offers little potential for growth. Secondary-stage brownfield investments (e.g., existing toll roads and hospitals) are the least risky and offer the lowest return. Greenfield investments (e.g., new toll roads, renewable energy facilities) are subject to more uncertainty and may provide relatively lower yields in the near term, but offer greater growth potential. Infrastructure projects that rely on revenues from uncertain future demand tend to be the riskiest.\n",

    "Because of long-term contracts and barriers to entry, cash flows from equity investment in infrastructure are stable and have low correlation with public equities. Infrastructure debt also tends to be safer and less affected by economic cycles.
