    "\n",
    "Hedge funds are private pooled investment vehicles that are generally available only to qualified or accredited investors. While these funds were traditionally designed to use long and short exposures to generate positive returns in any market, they have evolved to pursue a wide variety of strategies. Unlike mutual funds, hedge funds tend to be lightly regulated, and their managers have great freedom in selecting investment strategies. The primary return drivers for hedge funds are market inefficiency and price volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hedge funds invest in traditional asset classes (debt and equity), use leverage, and use derivatives in pursuit of their strategies. Hedge funds are often evaluated on a total return or risk-adjusted return basis, rather than against a benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hedge fund managers often invest their own money in their funds. Performance fees for hedge fund managers may be linked to a **high-water mark** requirement, whereby performance fees are payable only when the fund value exceeds its highest prior value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutual funds, REITs, and ETFs are all publicly traded, while hedge funds are privately held. Unlike private equity funds, hedge funds tend to invest mostly in liquid asset classes and have a shorter time horizon. Private equity funds require a longer time horizon, while hedge funds have periodic redemptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hedge Fund Categories\n",
    "We can classify hedge funds by the strategies they pursue. Here we list some examples of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Equity hedge fund strategies** seek to profit from long or short positions in publicly traded equities and derivatives with equities as their underlying assets. Short positions taken to reduce or remove overall market risk can be in a market index if a manager does not have a negative opinion on specific securities. Subcategories include the following:\n",
    "    * **Fundamental long/short.** Use long positions in undervalued securities based on fundamental analysis while simultaneously having a short position in a portfolio of stocks or an index. This strategy seeks to capture alpha when a market correction occurs. Most managers have net long exposure (i.e., a long bias).   **contrarian strategy**\n",
    "    * **Fundamental growth.** Use fundamental analysis to find high-growth companies. Identify and buy equities of companies that are expected to sustain relatively high rates of capital appreciation, and short equities of companies expected to have low or no revenue growth. Typically, these funds have a net long bias. **capital appreciation**\n",
    "    * **Fundamental value.** Buy equity shares that are believed to be undervalued, and short equities believed to be overvalued, based on fundamental analysis. The performance of value stocks relative to growth stocks drives performance.  **fundamental analysis**  future revenue and cash flow growth.\n",
    "    * **Market neutral.** Use technical or fundamental analysis to select undervalued equities to be held long and to select overvalued equities to be sold short, in approximately equal amounts to profit from their relative price movements without exposure to market risk. Leverage may be used. **under and overvalued valuation and long/short -- position neutral with respect to mkt risk**\n",
    "    * **Short bias.** Employ technical, quantitative, and fundamental analysis and take predominantly short positions in overvalued equities, possibly with smaller long positions but with negative market exposure overall. This is a contrarian strategy that focuses on the manager's skills at discerning flawed business strategies or accounting.**technical and fundamental analysis short only**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Event-driven strategies** are typically based on a corporate restructuring or acquisition that creates profit opportunities for long or short positions in common equity, preferred equity, or debt of a specific corporation. Event-driven funds are typically long biased. Subcategories are as follows:\n",
    "    * **Merger arbitrage.** Buy the shares of a firm being acquired and sell short the firm making the acquisition. Although the term arbitrage is used, such a strategy is not risk free because deal terms may change or an announced merger may not take place.  big risk is the deal fails to happen!  and unwinds!\n",
    "    * **Distressed/restructuring.** Buy the securities of firms in financial distress when analysis indicates that value will be increased by a successful restructuring, and possibly short overvalued securities at the same time.  troubled, bankruptcy?  -- betting long the debt for a successful restructuring.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * **Activist shareholder.** Buy sufficient equity shares to influence a company's policies, with the goal of increasing company value (e.g., by restructuring, change in strategy or management, or return of capital to equity holders).   trying to gain board seats to influence company decisions / coporate policy or direction..  activist HF could advocate for restructuring, capital distributions to shareholders, changes in management and company strategy affecting their equity holding with the goal of increasing value of the company\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * **Special situations.** Invest in the securities of firms that are issuing or repurchasing securities, spinning off divisions, selling assets, or distributing capital.  one off's.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Relative value strategies** involve buying a security and selling short a related security, with the goal of profiting when a perceived pricing discrepancy between the two is resolved. Subcategories include the following:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * **Convertible arbitrage fixed income.** Exploit pricing discrepancies between convertible bonds and the common stock of the issuing companies and options on the common shares.  seeks to exploit percieved mispricing between company's convertible bond and it's component parts - the underlying bond and the embedded stock option relative to the pricing of the underlying common stock.  Strategy goes long the convertable debt securities, simultaneously going short some of the same issuers common stock.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * **Specific fixed income (ABS/MBS/high yield).** Exploit pricing and quality discrepancies.  ABS, MBS, high yield. -- relative value of various higher yielding securities.  Funds seeking both earn an attractive highly secured coupon and to exploit relative security and quality mis-pricings\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * **General fixed income.** Exploit pricing discrepancies among fixed-income securities of various issuers and types.  various issuers and types, relative value with the FI markets -- looking for inconsistencies in interest rates, spot rates, or forward rates, between similar securities.  Strategies may incorporate long/short trades between two different issuers between corporate and government issuers or between different parts of an issuers yield curve.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * **Multistrategy.** Exploit pricing discrepancies among securities within and across asset classes and markets.  they trade relative value across all asset classes.  any available investment oppurtunity, often with different managers executing unique market approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Opportunistic strategies** focus on macro events and commodity trading. Often, these strategies are implemented using ETFs or derivatives in addition to individual securities. Subcategories include the following:\n",
    "      \n",
    "      * **Macro strategies** are based on global economic trends and events and may involve long or short positions in equities, fixed income, currencies, or commodities. These funds benefit from heightened volatility surrounding major events. Smoothing of economic shocks by central bank actions reduce the attractiveness of these strategies.  -- focused on macro investment vs. specific companies.  Use long and short positions in securities, currencies, commodities, fixed income, etc.  in order to profit from overall view of market direction. or global economic trends / overall market conditions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "     * **Managed futures** funds may focus on trading commodity futures (these funds are known as commodity trading advisers, or CTAs) or incorporate financial futures. Commodity prices tend to behave differently than financial assets, in that high prices tend to decrease demand (which in turn decreases prices), while low prices reduce supply (which in turn increases prices). actively managed funds making directional investments primarily in futures markets based on technical and fundamental analysis.  CTA commodity trading advisers.   because it historically focused on commodity futures.  may incorporate financial futures.\n"

    "\n",
    "* high fees\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* lack of transparancy  - for more complex hedgefunds\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* low liquidity\n",
    "    * **Liquidity gate:**  Partial restrictions on redemptions (fees if withdrawn early)\n",
    "    * **Notice period:**  Days within funds must fulfill redemption request (30-90 days)\n",
    "    * **Lockout periods:**  minimum time before investor can withdraw funds.\n",
    "    * They have lower liquidity, including lockup periods and liquidity gates. A **lockup period** is the time after initial investment over which limited partners either cannot request redemptions or incur significant fees for redemptions (a soft lockup). A **notice period** is the amount of time a fund has to fulfill a redemption request made after the lockup period has passed. A **liquidity gate** is a partial restriction on redemptions (i.e., less than a full suspension of them).\n",
    "    \\\n",
    "     Hedge fund managers often incur significant transactions costs when they redeem shares. Redemption fees can offset these costs. Notice periods and liquidity gates allow time for managers to reduce positions in an orderly manner. Redemptions often increase when hedge fund performance is poor over a period, and the costs of honoring redemptions may further decrease the value of the remaining partnership interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is reduced transparency about strategies followed and investments made by the fund to protect proprietary trading methods. This makes it difficult for investors and analysts to assign accurate values to a hedge fund's holdings.\n",

    "Hedge funds can be structured as commingled funds, whereby capital from many investors is pooled together, or as a **separately managed account (SMA)** for a single large investor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commingled funds often have a **master-feeder structure** that is designed to be tax efficient, enjoys economies of scale, and allows for funding from global investors. Under such a structure, there are two feeder funds: offshore (in a tax haven) and onshore. Both funds flow into a master fund, which makes the investments. The master-feeder structure bypasses regional regulatory requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "SMAs allow for a customized portfolio to meet an investor's risk/return objectives. One concern is that the manager has no stake in the fund, so the manager's interests are not as well aligned with those of the investor as they would be in a typical commingled fund. SMAs also require more operational oversight and thus are appropriate for larger or institutional investors. The benefit of lower negotiated fees in SMA structure is offset by the disadvantage of receiving allocations of only the fund manager's most liquid trades.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hedge funds are typically structured as limited partnerships or limited liability corporations. The general partner is the fund manager and receives compensation based on the fund's performance. The contractual relationships between the GP and LPs are laid out in the fund documents: partnership agreement, **private placement memorandum**, or articles of incorporation. Typically, a fund is structured to have an indefinite life, though most funds do wind down as they are liquidated on a regular basis.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** \\\n",
    "Convertible bond arbitrage aims to be market neutral to exploit mispricing an underlying bond and its embedded call option. Fundamental long/short is an equity hedge fund strategy that takes long positions in undervalued companies and short stocks or an index to reduce risk, typically maintaining a long bias. Distressed/restructuring is an event-driven strategy that tends to be long biased; it invests in discounted debt in companies in or near bankruptcy.\n",
