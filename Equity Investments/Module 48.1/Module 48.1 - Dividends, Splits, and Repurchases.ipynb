    "### LOS 48.a: Evaluate whether a security, given its current market price and a value estimate, is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued by the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the reading on Market Efficiency that **intrinsic value** or **fundamental value** is defined as the rational value investors would place on the asset if they had full knowledge of the asset's characteristics. Analysts use valuation models to estimate the intrinsic values of stocks and compare them to the stocks' market prices to determine whether individual stocks are overvalued, undervalued, or fairly valued. In doing valuation analysis for stocks, analysts are assuming that some stocks' prices deviate significantly from their intrinsic values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To the extent that market prices deviate from intrinsic values, analysts who can estimate a stock's intrinsic value better than the market can earn abnormal profits if the stock's market price moves toward its intrinsic value over time. There are several things to consider, however, in deciding whether to invest based on differences between market prices and estimated intrinsic values.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The larger the percentage difference between market prices and estimated values, the more likely the investor is to take a position based on the estimate of intrinsic value. Small differences between market prices and estimates of intrinsic values are to be expected.\n",
    "2. The more confident the investor is about the appropriateness of the valuation model used, the more likely the investor is to take an investment position in a stock that is identified as overvalued or undervalued.\n",
    "3. The more confident the investor is about the estimated inputs used in the valuation model, the more likely the investor is to take an investment position in a stock that is identified as overvalued or undervalued. Analysts must also consider the sensitivity of a model value to each of its inputs in deciding whether to act on a difference between model values and market prices. If a decrease of one-half percent in the long-term growth rate used in the valuation model would produce an estimated value equal to the market price, an analyst would have to be quite sure of the model's growth estimate to take a position in the stock based on its estimated value.\n",
    "4. Even if we assume that market prices sometimes deviate from intrinsic values, market prices must be treated as fairly reliable indications of intrinsic value. Investors must consider why a stock is mispriced in the market. Investors may be more confident about estimates of value that differ from market prices when few analysts follow a particular security.\n",
    "5. Finally, to take a position in a stock identified as mispriced in the market, an investor must believe that the market price will actually move toward (and certainly not away from) its estimated intrinsic value and that it will do so to a significant extent within the investment time horizon.\n",

    "### LOS 48.b: Describe major categories of equity valuation models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysts use a variety of models to estimate the value of equities. Usually, an analyst will use more than one model with several different sets of inputs to determine a range of possible stock values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **discounted cash flow models** (or **present value models**), a stock's value is estimated as the present value of cash distributed to shareholders (*dividend discount models*) or the present value of cash available to shareholders after the firm meets its necessary capital expenditures and working capital expenses (*free cash flow to equity models*).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic types of **multiplier models** (or **market multiple models**) that can be used to estimate intrinsic values. In the first type, the ratio of stock price to such fundamentals as earnings, sales, book value, or cash flow per share is used to determine if a stock is fairly valued. For example, the price to earnings (P/E) ratio is frequently used by analysts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second type of multiplier model is based on the ratio of **enterprise value** to either earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) or revenue. Enterprise value is the market value of all a firm's outstanding securities minus cash and short-term investments. Common stock value can be estimated by subtracting the value of liabilities and preferred stock from an estimate of enterprise value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **asset-based models**, the intrinsic value of common stock is estimated as total asset value minus liabilities and preferred stock. Analysts typically adjust the book values of the firm's assets and liabilities to their fair values when estimating the market value of its equity with an asset-based model.\n",

    "### LOS 48.c: Describe regular cash dividends, extra dividends, stock dividends, stock splits, reverse stock splits, and share repurchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cash dividends**, as the name implies, are payments made to shareholders in cash. They may be regularly scheduled dividends or one-time special dividends. **Regular dividends** occur when a company pays out a portion of profits on a consistent schedule (e.g., quarterly). A long-term record of stable or increasing dividends is widely viewed by investors as a sign of a company's financial stability. **Special dividends** are used when favorable circumstances allow the firm to make a one-time cash payment to shareholders, in addition to any regular dividends the firm pays. Many cyclical firms (e.g., automakers) will use a special dividend to share profits with shareholders when times are good but maintain the flexibility to conserve cash when profits are poor. Other names for special dividends include *extra dividends* and *irregular dividends*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stock dividends** are dividends paid out in new shares of stock rather than cash. In this case, there will be more shares outstanding, but each one will be worth less. Total shareholders' equity remains unchanged. Stock dividends are commonly expressed as a percentage. A 20% stock dividend means every shareholder gets 20% more stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/PachaTech/CFA-Level-1/blob/main/Equity%20Investments/Module%2048.1/pics/04.png?raw=true\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stock splits** divide each existing share into multiple shares, creating more shares. There are now more shares, but the price of each share will drop correspondingly to the number of shares created, so there is no change in the owner's wealth. Splits are expressed as a ratio. In a 3-for-1 stock split, each old share is split into three new shares. Stock splits are currently more common than stock dividends.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reverse stock splits** are the opposite of stock splits. After a reverse split, there are fewer shares outstanding but there is a higher stock price. Because these factors offset one another, shareholder wealth is unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **share repurchase** is a transaction in which a company buys outstanding shares of its own common stock. Share repurchases are an alternative to cash dividends as a way of distributing cash to shareholders, and they have the same effect on shareholders' wealth as cash dividends of the same size. A company might repurchase shares to support their price or to signal that management believes the shares are undervalued. Share repurchases may also be used to offset an increase in outstanding shares from the exercise of employee stock options. In countries that tax capital gains at lower rates than dividends, shareholders may prefer share repurchases to dividend payments as a way to distribute cash to shareholders.\n",
