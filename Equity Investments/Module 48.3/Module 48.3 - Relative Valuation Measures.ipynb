    "### LOS 48.j: Explain the rationale for using price multiples to value equity, how the price to earnings multiple relates to fundamentals, and the use of multiples based on comparables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the dividend discount model is very sensitive to its inputs, many investors rely on other methods. In a **price multiple** approach, an analyst compares a stock's price multiple to a benchmark value based on an index, industry group of firms, or a peer group of firms within an industry. Common price multiples used for valuation include price-to-earnings, price-to-cash flow, price-to-sales, and price-to-book value ratios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Price multiples are widely used by analysts and readily available in numerous media outlets. Price multiples are easily calculated and can be used in time series and cross-sectional comparisons. Many of these ratios have been shown to be useful for predicting stock returns, with low multiples associated with higher future returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "A critique of price multiples is that they reflect only the past because historical (trailing) data are often used in the denominator. For this reason, many practitioners use forward (leading or prospective) values in the denominator. The use of projected values can result in much different ratios. An analyst should be sure to use price multiple calculations consistently across firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we compare a price multiple, such as P/E, for a firm to those of other firms based on market prices, we are using **price multiples based on comparables**. By contrast, **price multiples based on fundamentals** tell us what a multiple should be based on some valuation model and therefore are not dependent on the current market prices of other companies to establish value."

    "This P/E based on fundamentals is also referred to as a **justified P/E**. It is \"justified\" because, assuming we have the correct inputs for $D_1$, $E_1$, $k_e$, and $g$, the previous equation will provide a P/E ratio that is based on the present value of the future cash flows. We refer to this as a *<u>leading</u> P/E ratio* because it is based on expected earnings next period, not on actual earnings for the previous period, which would produce a <u>lagging</u> or *<u>trailing P/E ratio</u>*.\n",

    "First, we must estimate the market value of the firm's short-term debt and liabilities. To do so, subtract the book value of long-term debt from the book value of total debt: \\\\$2,100,000 – \\\\$900,000 = $1,200,000. This is the book value of the firm's short-term debt. We can assume the market value of these short-term items is close to their book value. (As we will see in the Study Session on fixed income valuation, the market values of debt instruments approach their face values as they get close to maturity.)\n",

    "### LOS 48.m: Describe asset-based valuation models and their use in estimating equity value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our third category of valuation model is **asset-based models**, which are based on the idea that equity value is the market or fair value of assets minus the market or fair value of liabilities. Because market values of firm assets are usually difficult to obtain, the analyst typically starts with the balance sheet to determine the values of assets and liabilities. In most cases, market values are not equal to book values. Possible approaches to valuing assets are to value them at their depreciated values, inflation-adjusted depreciated values, or estimated replacement values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying asset-based models is especially problematic for a firm that has a large amount of intangible assets, on or off the balance sheet. The effect of the loss of the current owners' talents and customer relationships on forward earnings may be quite difficult to measure. Analysts often consider asset-based model values as floor or minimum values when significant intangibles, such as business reputation, are involved. An analyst should consider supplementing an asset-based valuation with a more forward-looking valuation, such as one from a discounted cash flow model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asset-based model valuations are most reliable when the firm has primarily tangible short-term assets, assets with ready market values (e.g., financial or natural resource firms), or when the firm will cease to operate and is being liquidated. Asset-based models are often used to value private companies but may be increasingly useful for public firms as they move toward fair value reporting on the balance sheet."
