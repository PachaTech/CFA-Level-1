    "The cash flow statement provides information to assess the firm's liquidity, solvency, and financial flexibility. An analyst can use the statement of cash flows to determine the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Whether regular operations generate enough cash to sustain the business\n",
    "* Whether enough cash is generated to pay off existing debts as they mature\n",
    "* Whether the firm is likely to need additional financing\n",
    "* Whether unexpected obligations can be met\n",
    "* Whether the firm can take advantage of new business opportunities as they arise\n",
    "\n",
    "Cash flow analysis begins with evaluating the firm's sources and uses of cash from operating, investing, and financing activities. Sources and uses of cash change as the firm moves through its life cycle. For example, when a firm is in the early stages of growth, it may experience negative operating cash flow as it uses cash to increase inventory and receivables. Early-stage firms usually finance this negative operating cash flow externally by issuing debt or equity securities. These sources of financing are not sustainable. Eventually, the firm must begin generating positive operating cash flow or external investors will stop providing capital. Over the long term, successful firms must generate operating cash flows that exceed capital expenditures and provide a return to debt and equity holders.\n",
    "\n",
    "An analyst should identify how a firm is generating its operating cash flow. The firm's earnings-related activities should provide its operating cash flow. However, a firm can also generate positive operating cash flow in the near term by decreasing noncash working capital, such as by liquidating inventory and receivables or increasing payables. Decreasing noncash working capital is not sustainable because inventories and receivables cannot fall below zero and creditors will not extend credit indefinitely unless payments are made when due.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operating cash flow provides a check on the quality of a firm's earnings. A stable relationship of operating cash flow and net income is an indication of quality earnings. Earnings that significantly exceed operating cash flow may be an indication of aggressive (or even improper) accounting choices such as recognizing revenues too soon or delaying the recognition of expenses. An analyst should also evaluate the variability of net income and operating cash flow as an indicator of a firm's risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "An analyst should also examine a firm's sources and uses of cash from investing activities. Increasing capital expenditures, a use of cash, is usually an indication of growth. Conversely, a firm may reduce capital expenditures or even sell capital assets to save or generate cash. An analyst should inquire into the reasons for this because it may result in higher cash outflows in the future when the firm needs to replace older fixed assets. Investing cash flows may also result from acquisitions or investments in securities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The financing activities section of the cash flow statement reveals information about whether the firm is generating cash flow by issuing debt or equity. It also indicates whether the firm is using cash to repay debt, reacquire stock, or pay dividends. For example, an analyst would certainly want to know if a firm issued debt and used the proceeds to reacquire stock or pay dividends to shareholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common-Size Cash Flow Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the income statement and balance sheet, an analyst can use common-size analysis to interpret a cash flow statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cash flow statement can be converted to common-size format by expressing each line item as a percentage of revenue. Alternatively, each inflow of cash can be expressed as a percentage of total cash inflows, and each outflow of cash can be expressed as a percentage of total cash outflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "A revenue-based common-size cash flow statement is useful for identifying trends and forecasting future cash flow. Because each line item of the cash flow statement is stated in terms of revenue, once future revenue is forecast, cash flows can be estimated for those items that are tied to revenue.\n",

    "Operating cash flow has decreased as a percentage of revenues. This appears to be due largely to accumulating inventories. Investing activities, specifically purchases of plant and equipment, have also required an increasing percentage of the firm's cash flow.
