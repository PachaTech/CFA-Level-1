    "### LOS 30.b: Describe general principles of expense recognition, specific expense recognition applications, implications of expense recognition choices for financial analysis and contrast costs that are capitalized versus those that are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Expenses are subtracted from revenue to calculate net income. According to the IASB, expenses are decreases in economic benefits during the accounting period in the form of outflows or depletions of assets, or incurrence of liabilities that result in decreases in equity other than those relating to distributions to equity participants.1\n",
    "\n",
    "If the financial statements were prepared on a cash basis, neither revenue recognition nor expense recognition would be an issue. The firm would simply recognize cash received as revenue and cash payments as expense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the accrual method of accounting, expense recognition is in the period in which the economic benefits of the expenditure are consumed. Three different methods are used to achieve this: the matching principle, expensing as incurred, and capitalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the **matching principle**, expenses to generate revenue are recognized in the same period as the revenue. Inventory provides a good example. Assume that inventory is purchased during the fourth quarter of one year and sold during the first quarter of the following year. Using the matching principle, both the revenue and the expense (cost of goods sold) are recognized in the first quarter of the second year, when the inventory is sold—not the period in which the inventory was purchased. Another example are goods that are sold with a warranty period. The estimated cost of repairing or replacing faulty goods under the warranty must be estimated and deducted from revenue at the time of sale, rather than when the actual costs are incurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Capitalization** is an application of the matching principle whereby costs are initially capitalized as assets on the balance sheet and then expensed, using depreciation or amortization, to the income statement over the asset's life as its benefits are consumed. Property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) and intangible assets with finite lives are examples of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all expenses can be directly tied to revenue generation. These costs are known as **period costs**. Period costs, such as administrative costs, are expensed in the period incurred. For example, if a firm has occupied a leased premise, one year's worth of rent should be expensed to the income statement regardless of whether the rent has been paid.\n",
    "\n",
    "An accounting policy that recognizes expenses later rather than sooner is seen as aggressive, while a policy that recognizes expenses earlier is conservative. Expensing is, therefore, more conservative than capitalization."

    "#### Example: Inventory and the matching principle\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a trading company that simply buys and resells goods. If the firm had 100 units of sales during the accounting period, we would expect to see cost of goods sold reflect 100 units of cost if we apply the matching principle. If the firm had 20 units of beginning inventory at the start of the year and purchased a further 90 units, the total number of units available for sale would be 110. The matching concept, therefore, requires the company to remove 10 units that are unsold from the income statement and store them in the balance sheet as a current asset (ending inventory). These 10 units will become the next period's beginning inventory.\n",

    "#### Capitalization vs. Expensing\n",
    "\n",
    "When a firm makes an expenditure, it can either capitalize the cost as an asset on the balance sheet or expense the cost in the income statement in the period incurred. As a general rule, an expenditure that is expected to provide a future economic benefit over multiple accounting periods is capitalized; however, if the future economic benefit is unlikely or highly uncertain, the expenditure is **expensed** in the period incurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "An expenditure that is capitalized is initially recorded as an asset on the balance sheet at cost, which is typically its fair value at acquisition plus any costs necessary to prepare the asset for use. Except for land and intangible assets with indefinite lives (such as acquisition goodwill), the cost is then allocated to the income statement over the life of the asset as **depreciation** expense (for tangible assets), **depletion** (for natural resources), or **amortization** expense (for intangible assets with finite lives). Depreciation, depletion, and amortization reduce the carrying value (net book value) of the asset in the balance sheet, and the expense reduces net income in the income statement. Alternatively, if an expenditure is immediately expensed, current-period pretax income is reduced by the amount of the expenditure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once an asset is capitalized, subsequent related expenditures that provide more future economic benefits (e.g., rebuilding the asset) are also capitalized. Subsequent expenditures that merely sustain the usefulness of the asset (e.g., regular maintenance) are expensed when incurred.\n"

    "\n",
    "When a firm constructs an asset for its own use or, in limited circumstances, for resale, the interest that accrues during the construction period is capitalized as a part of the asset's cost. The reasons for capitalizing interest are to accurately measure the cost of the asset and to better match the cost with the revenues generated by the constructed asset. The treatment of construction interest is similar under U.S. GAAP and IFRS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Capitalized interest is not reported in the income statement as interest expense. Once construction interest is capitalized, the interest cost is allocated to the income statement through depreciation expense (if the asset is held for use) or COGS (if the asset is held for sale).\n",
    "\n",
    "Capitalizing interest results in it being reported in the cash flow statement as an outflow from investing activities. This contrasts with the usual treatment of interest paid, which is reported as an outflow from operating activities under U.S. GAAP and can be an operating or financing outflow under IFRS.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an analyst, both capitalized and expensed interest should be used when calculating interest coverage ratios to get a clearer picture of the company's solvency. Analysts should also adjust income by adding back any depreciation of capitalized interest.\n"

    "With some exceptions, costs to create intangible assets are expensed as incurred. Important exceptions are research and development costs (under IFRS) and software development costs.\n",

    "Under IFRS, **research costs**, which are costs aimed at the discovery of new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, are expensed as incurred. However, **development costs** may be capitalized. Development costs are incurred to translate research findings into a plan or design of a new product or process. To recognize an intangible asset in development, a firm must show that it can complete the asset and intends to use or sell the completed asset, among other criteria.\n",

However, the costs of creating software for sale to others are treated in a manner similar to the treatment of research and development costs under IFRS. Costs incurred to develop software for sale to others are expensed as incurred until the product's technological feasibility has been established, after which the costs of developing a salable product are capitalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the financial statements comparable for a company that capitalizes development costs with one that expenses such costs, the income statement should be adjusted to include development costs as an expense, and any current amortization of development cost capitalized in the past should be removed. In the balance sheet, capitalized development costs should be removed, resulting in lower assets and equity. Adjusting the cash flow statement will require capitalized costs to be removed from CFI and included in CFO, which will decrease CFO.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Implications for Financial Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Like revenue recognition, expense recognition requires numerous estimates. Because estimates are involved, it is possible for firms to delay or accelerate the recognition of expenses. Delayed expense recognition increases current net income and is, therefore, more aggressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysts must consider the underlying reasons for a change in an expense estimate. If a firm decreases its bad debt expense, was it because its collection experience improved, or was it to manipulate net income?\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysts should also compare a firm's estimates to those of other firms in its industry. If a firm's warranty expense is significantly less than that of a peer firm, is that a result of higher quality products, or is the firm's expense recognition more aggressive than that of the peer firm?\n",
    "\n",
    "Firms disclose their accounting policies and significant estimates in the financial statement footnotes and in the management discussion and analysis (MD&A) section of the annual report."
