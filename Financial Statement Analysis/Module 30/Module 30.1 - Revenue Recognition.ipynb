    "### LOS 30.a: Describe general principles of revenue recognition, specific revenue recognition applications, and implications of revenue recognition choices for financial analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sale of goods where the goods or services are exchanged for cash and returns are not allowed, the recognition of revenue is straightforward: it is recognized at the time of the exchange. The recognition of revenue is not, however, dependent on receiving cash payment. If a sale of goods is made on credit, revenue can be recognized at the time of sale—and an asset, **accounts receivable**, is created on the balance sheet. As a general rule, revenue is recognized in the period in which it is earned, which may not necessarily be the same as the period in which cash is collected from the customer. Revenue is reported net of any returns and allowances in the income statement (e.g., estimated warranty provisions and customer discounts).\n",
    "\n",
    "If payment for the goods is received before the transfer of the goods or services, a liability, **unearned revenue**, is created when the cash is received (offsetting the increase in the asset cash). Revenue is recognized as the goods are transferred to the buyer. As an example, consider a magazine subscription. When the subscription is purchased, an unearned revenue liability is created, and as magazine issues are delivered, revenue is recorded and the liability is decreased.\n",
    "\n",
    "Converged standards under IFRS and U.S. GAAP take a principles-based approach to revenue recognition issues. The central principle is that a firm should recognize revenue when it has transferred a good or service to a customer. This is consistent with the familiar accrual accounting principle that revenue should be recognized when earned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The converged standards identify a five-step process1 for recognizing revenue:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the contract(s) with a customer.\n",
    "2. Identify the separate or distinct performance obligations in the contract.\n",
    "3. Determine the transaction price.\n",
    "4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.\n",
    "5. Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard defines a **contract** as an agreement between two or more parties that specifies their obligations and rights. Collectability must be probable for a contract to exist, but probable is defined differently under IFRS and U.S. GAAP, so an identical activity could still be accounted for differently by IFRS and U.S. GAAP reporting firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **performance obligation** is a promise to deliver a distinct good or service. A distinct good or service is one that meets the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or combined with other resources that are readily available.\n",
    "* The promise to transfer the good or service can be identified separately from any other promises.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **transaction price** is the amount a firm expects to receive from a customer in exchange for transferring a good or service to the customer. A transaction price is usually a fixed amount, but it can also be variable (e.g., if it includes a bonus for early delivery).\n",
    "\n",
    "A firm should recognize revenue only when it is highly probable that it will not have to reverse it. For example, a firm may need to recognize a liability for a refund obligation (and an offsetting asset for the right to returned goods) if revenue from a sale cannot be estimated reliably.\n",
    "\n",
    "A firm recognizes revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the control of the good or service from seller to buyer. Indicators that the customer has obtained control include physical possession by the customer, acceptance of the good or service by the customer, the customer taking on risk and benefits of ownership, the customer holding legal title, and the seller having a right of payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For long-term contracts, revenue is recognized based on a firm's progress toward completing a performance obligation over a period of time. Progress toward completion can be measured from the input side (e.g., using the percentage of completion costs incurred as of the statement date). Progress can also be measured from the output side, using engineering milestones or the percentage of total output delivered to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "A performance obligation is satisfied over a period of time if any of the following three criteria are met:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The customer receives and benefits from the good or service over time as the supplier meets the obligations of the contract (e.g., service and maintenance contracts).\n",
    "2. The supplier enhances an existing asset or creates a new asset that the customer controls over the period in which the asset is created or enhanced.\n",
    "3. The asset has no alternative use for the supplier, and the supplier has the right to enforce payment for work completed to date (e.g., constructing equipment specific to the needs of a single customer).\n",
    "\n",
    "The costs to secure a long-term contract, such as sales commissions, must be capitalized; that is, the expense for these costs is spread over the life of the contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following summarizes some examples from IFRS 15 of appropriate revenue recognition under various circumstances.\n"

    "#### Example: Revenue recognition\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Performance obligation and progress toward completion (long-term contracts)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    A contractor agrees to build a warehouse for a price of €10 million and estimates the total costs of construction at €8 million. Although there are several identifiable components of the building (site preparation, foundation, electrical components, roof, etc.), these components are not *separate deliverables*, and the performance obligation is the completed building.\n",
    "\n",
    "    During the first year of construction, the builder incurs €4 million of costs, 50\\% of the estimated total costs of completion. Based on this expenditure and a belief that the percentage of costs incurred represents an appropriate measure of progress toward completing the performance obligation, the builder recognizes €5 million (50\\% of the transaction price of €10 million) as revenue for the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "    During the second year of construction, the contractor incurred an additional €2 million in costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The percentage of total costs incurred over the first two years is now (€4 million + €2 million) / €8 million = 75%. The total revenue to be recognized to date is 0.75 × €10 million = €7.5 million. Because €5 million of revenue had been recognized in Year 1, €2.5 million (= €7.5 million – €5 million) of revenue will be recognized in Year 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This treatment is consistent with the percentage of completion method previously in use, although the new standards do not call it that.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <p> <br> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Acting as an agent**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Consider a travel agent who arranges a first-class ticket for a customer flying to Singapore. The ticket price is €10,000, made by nonrefundable payment at purchase, and the travel agent receives a €1,000 commission on the sale. Because the travel agent is not responsible for providing the flight and bears no inventory or credit risk, *they are acting as an agent*. Because they are an agent, rather than a *principal*, they should report revenue equal to their commission of €1,000, the net amount of the sale. If they were a principal in the transaction, they would report revenue of €10,000, the gross amount of the sale, and an expense of €9,000 for the ticket. Note that while gross profit is the same (€1,000) regardless of selling as a principal or agent, the gross profit margin is very different. If treated as a principal, the margin would be €1,000 / €10,000 = 10\\%, but as an agent, the margin would be €1,000 / €1,000 = 100\\%.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <p> <br> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Franchising and licensing**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Consider a fast food company that both operates restaurants and grants franchisees rights to operate restaurants using its brand name under license, and supplies franchisees with some products used in daily operations. As well as charging a license fee, the company also receives a royalty fee of 2% of the franchisee's turnover. Accounting standards require revenue to be split into categories that have similar characteristics (nature, amounts, timings, and risk factors).\n",
    "\n",
    "    The fast food company would disaggregate revenue into these categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Revenue from company-owned restaurants\n",
    "    * Franchise royalties and fees\n",
    "    * Revenue from supplies to franchises (equipment and food materials)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Franchise fees often grant the franchisee the right to operate over numerous periods and would initially be treated as deferred revenue. Subsequently, it would be amortized to revenue in the income statement over the life of the franchise contract period.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Royalty fees would be included periodically in the franchisor's accounts when they become contractually payable by the franchisee under the terms of the contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <p> <br> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Service versus license**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Consider a software supplier that allows customers to purchase a license and install the software on their own machines, or subscribe to a cloud-based solution with access over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If customers purchase a license and install the software on their own systems, IFRS allows for two treatments:\n",
    "    1. The software supplier will report revenue over the life of the contract.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * The software supplier will continue to update and enhance the software over the term of the license.\n",
    "        * Customers will be exposed to potential benefits or negative impacts from updates and enhancements.\n",
    "        * Updates and enhancements do not result in a transfer of goods or services.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. The software supplier will report revenue at the outset of the contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * The license grants the customer the right to use the software as it exists at the start of the contract (\"sold as is\").\n",
    "        * A separate contract exists for enhancements and updates to the software. The revenue for support services will be recognized when provided (typically over the life of the contract).\n",
    "\n",
    "    If customers access the software without taking physical possession of the software (i.e., cloud-based access), the contract is for a service, and revenue should be recognized over the life of the contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <p> <br> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Bill-and-hold agreements**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Bill-and-hold agreements are a type of sales agreement that involves the customer paying for goods ahead of shipping. Typically, when a customer pays ahead of delivery, the revenue is treated as deferred, but revenue may be recorded before shipping if the supplier can demonstrate that its performance obligations are complete and the customer has control over the good. IFRS criteria include the following: the customer asked for the arrangement, the goods are identified as belonging to the customer, the goods are complete and ready for transfer to the customer, and the goods cannot be redirected to another customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <p> <br> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Required disclosures under the converged standards include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Contracts with customers by category\n",
    "* Assets and liabilities related to contracts, including balances and changes\n",
    "* Outstanding performance obligations and the transaction prices allocated to them\n",
    "* Management judgments used to determine the amount and timing of revenue recognition, including any changes to those judgments\n",
