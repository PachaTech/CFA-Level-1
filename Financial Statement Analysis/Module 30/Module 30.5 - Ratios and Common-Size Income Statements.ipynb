    "Revenue is recognized when earned, and expenses are recognized when incurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accounting standards identify a five-step process for recognizing revenue:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the contract(s) with a customer.\n",
    "2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract.\n",
    "3. Determine the transaction price.\n",
    "4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.\n",
    "5. Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information that can influence the choice of revenue recognition method includes progress toward completion of a performance obligation, variable considerations and their likelihood of being earned, revisions to contracts, and whether the firm is acting as a principal or an agent in a transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LOS 30.b\n",
    "\n",
    "The matching principle requires that firms match revenues recognized in a period with the expenses required to generate them. One application of the matching principle is seen in accounting for inventory, with cost of goods sold as the cost of units sold from inventory that are included in current-period revenue. Other costs, such as depreciation of fixed assets or administrative overhead, are period costs, and they are taken without regard to revenues generated during the period.\n",
    "\n",
    "With capitalization, the asset value is put on the balance sheet, and the cost is expensed through the income statement over the asset's useful life through either depreciation or amortization. Compared to expensing, capitalization results in the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lower expense and higher net income in period of acquisition, and higher expense (depreciation or amortization) and lower net income in each of the remaining years of the asset's life\n",
    "* Higher assets and equity\n",
    "* Lower CFI and higher CFO because the cost of a capitalized asset is classified as an investing cash outflow\n",
    "* Higher ROE and ROA in the initial period, and lower ROE and ROA in subsequent periods because net income is lower and both assets and equity are higher\n",
    "* Lower debt-to-assets and debt-to-equity ratios because assets and equity are higher\n",
    "\n",
    "Users of financial data should analyze the reasons for any changes in estimates of expenses and compare these estimates with those of peer companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### LOS 30.c\n",
    "\n",
    "Results of discontinued operations are reported below income from continuing operations, net of tax, from the date the decision to dispose of the operations is made. These results are segregated because they likely are nonrecurring and do not affect future net income.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unusual or infrequent items are reported before tax and above income from continuing operations. An analyst should determine how \"unusual\" or \"infrequent\" these items really are for the company when estimating future earnings or firm value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes in accounting standards, changes in accounting methods applied, and corrections of accounting errors require retrospective restatement of all prior-period financial statements included in the current statement. A change in an accounting estimate, however, is applied prospectively (to subsequent periods) with no restatement of prior-period results.\n",
