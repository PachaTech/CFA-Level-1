    "\n",
    "A s**tock dividend** is the distribution of additional shares to each shareholder in an amount proportional to their current number of shares. If a 10% stock dividend is paid, the holder of 100 shares of stock would receive 10 additional shares.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **stock split** refers to the division of each \"old\" share into a specific number of \"new\" (post-split) shares. The holder of 100 shares will have 200 shares after a 2-for-1 split, or 150 shares after a 3-for-2 split.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important thing to remember is that each shareholder's proportional ownership in the company is unchanged by either of these events. Each shareholder has more shares but the same percentage of the total shares outstanding. For calculating EPS, we apply stock dividends and splits retroactively to the beginning of the year, to all shares before the date of the corporate event. Prior years' weighted average number of common shares is also adjusted as if the stock split or stock dividend had occurred in the prior period, to prevent EPS from appearing to decline when these actions are largely cosmetic.\n",

    "For our purposes here, a stock dividend and a stock split are two ways of doing the same thing. For example, a 50% stock dividend and a 3-for-2 stock split both result in three \"new\" shares for every two \"old\" shares.    \n",

    "* Shares sold or issued in a purchase of assets are included from the date of issuance.\n",
