    "### LOS 30.c: Describe the financial reporting treatment and analysis of non-recurring items (including discontinued operations, unusual or infrequent items) and changes in accounting policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of **unusual or infrequent items** is obviousâ€”these events are either unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence and are material (significant enough to affect the opinions of financial statement users). Examples of items that could be considered unusual or infrequent include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reported \"Pre-tax\" and above net income from continuing operations (above the line).  Because it's reported on the income statement above \"tax\" and net income it's, often referred to as \"above-the-line.\"\n",
    "-\n",
    "* Items include the folliwing:\n",
    "    * Gain (loss) from disposal of business segment or assets\n",
    "    * Gain (loss) from the sale of assets or part of a business, if these activities are not a firm's ordinary operations\n",
    "    * Gain (loss) from sale of investment in subsidiary\n",
    "    * Proivisions for environmental remediation (Mining, Oil extraction, etc. provision in place)\n",
    "    * Impairments, write-offs, and write-downs\n",
    "    * Restructuring costs\n",
    "    * Integration expense for recently acquired business.  Costs of integrating a business into their existing companies.\n",
    " \n",
    "Unusual or infrequent items are included in income from continuing operations and are reported before tax.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "Analysts should review unusual or infrequent items to determine whether they truly should be excluded when forecasting a firm's earnings, because occassional there quite alot of infrequent or unusual items. Some companies appear to be accident-prone and have \"unusual or infrequent\" losses every year or every few years.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discontinued Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "* Operations that management has decided to dispose of but (1) has not done so yet or (2) did so in the current year after it generated profit or loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reported <FONT COLOR=\"#ff0000\"><u>net of taxes after income from continuing operations</u></FONT> (below the line)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assets, operation, and financing activities must be physically and operationally distinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "from an anlalyst's perspective:  discontinued operations, the profits or losses from this in the income statement <FONT COLOR=\"#ff0000\">does NOT</font> affect net income, because it's below net income. that means you should not include it when you are forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "from a logical forecasting perspective: forecasting is looking at future performance, but if this is discontinued, then it won't be there in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not included in the net income for the current statement, but it is below net income, but  <FONT COLOR=\"#ff0000\">should be excluded for forecasting</font>.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **discontinued operation** is one that management has decided to dispose of, but either has not yet done so, or has disposed of in the current year after the operation had generated income or losses. To be accounted for as a discontinued operation, the business must be physically and operationally distinct from the rest of the firm, in terms of assets, operations, and investing and financing activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The date when the company develops a formal plan for disposing of an operation is referred to as the measurement date, and the time between the measurement period and the actual disposal date is referred to as the phaseout period. Any income or loss from discontinued operations is reported separately in the income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations. Any past income statements presented must be restated, separating the income or loss from the discontinued operations. On the measurement date, the company will accrue any estimated loss during the phaseout period, and any estimated loss on the sale of the business. Any expected gain on the disposal cannot be reported until after the sale is completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of discontinued operations is straightforward: They do not affect net income from continuing operations. For this reason, analysts should exclude discontinued operations when forecasting future earnings. However, the actual event of discontinuing a business segment or selling assets may provide information about the future cash flows of the firm.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Changes in Accounting Policies and Estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A change in accounting policy (e.g. revenue recognition method) requires  <FONT COLOR=\"#ff0000\">retrospective application</font> which means that for most financial statements when they are produced would show the current year and the prior year (assuming it's not the first year the business exists); adjust this year changes and apply it to any prior years' financials included in current statement.  Most likely current and prior years.  Maybe it includes a change revenue recognition standards, for example, a change in your inventory, from LIFO to FIFO, and that would need to be retrospectively changed for prior years'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A change in accounting estimate is treated  <FONT COLOR=\"#ff0000\">prospectively</font>; does not require restatement of prior-period earnings.  not a change in estimate and not a change in the standard itself or not a change in which policy is being applied but just a change in how an estimate is being calculated.  So, for example, if you're applying straight line depreciation, you have to define what the useful life of the estimate is going to be.  Or perhaps, you've updated that useful life, or have company autos & vehicles, and would trade and sell or update them every 5 years, and changed it to 6 years, well the useful estimated life of those assets would change, because you plan to keep a bit longer, which would update the estimate and therefore the depreciation calculated.  In most cases it is treated <FONT COLOR=\"#ff0000\">prospectively</font>; which means you do not have to go back and re-state any prior period figures, you only have to update things from the current period onwards\n",
    "\n",
    "Neither of these should affect the cashflow of the business:  It's more about the incomes statement and the balance sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "<FONT COLOR=\"#ff0000\">What does this mean from an analyst's perspective?</font>  Well, it's important to keep up to date with any changes in accounting policies.  Also, to be aware of any changes a business makes with regards to their to their estimates so you can accurately \n",
    "forecast what their financials may be looking like going forwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main changes in accounting: either a change in policy or estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accounting changes include changes in accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates, and prior-period adjustments. Such changes may require either **retrospective application** or **prospective application**. With retrospective application, any prior-period financial statements presented in a firm's current financial statements must be restated, applying the new policy to those statements as well as future statements. Retrospective application enhances the comparability of the financial statements over time. With prospective application, prior statements are not restated, and the new policies are applied only to future financial statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard-setting bodies, at times, issue a **change in accounting policy**. Sometimes, a firm may change which accounting policy it applies, for example, by changing its inventory costing method or capitalizing rather than expensing specific purchases. Unless it is impractical, changes in accounting policies require retrospective application.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the recent change to revenue recognition standards, firms were given the option of modified retrospective application. This application does not require restatement of prior-period statements; however, beginning values of affected accounts are adjusted for the cumulative effects of the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, a **change in accounting estimate** is the result of a change in management's judgment, usually due to new information. For example, management may change the estimated useful life of an asset because new information indicates that the asset has a longer or shorter life than originally expected. Changes in accounting estimates are applied prospectively and do not require the restatement of prior financial statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accounting estimate changes typically do not affect cash flow. An analyst should review changes in accounting estimates to determine their impact on future operating results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, a change from an incorrect accounting method to one that is acceptable under GAAP or IFRS is required. A correction of an accounting error made in previous financial statements is reported as a **prior-period adjustment** and requires retrospective application. Prior-period results are restated. Disclosure of the nature of any significant prior-period adjustment and its effect on net income is also required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior-period adjustments usually involve errors or new accounting standards and do not typically affect cash flow. Analysts should review adjustments carefully because errors may indicate weaknesses in the firm's internal controls.\n",

    "##### Examples of  Scope Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mergers and acquisitions reduce comparability  (most typical), because the financial statements no longer just cover the performance and position of just one business, but either a merged larger business or a few different businesses if there's been acquisitions and there's been consolidated accounts.  \n",

    "* Balance shets of parent and subsidiary combined at acquisition date\n",

    "\n",
    "<FONT COLOR=\"#ff0000\">What does this mean from an analyst's perspective?</font> If there's been a change in scope, i.e. how many businesses or how large a business is reported on, then that's going to reduce the comparability from prior years *significantly*.  The balance sheet, if it's an acquisition of the parent or the subsidiary are going to be combined, so it may look like the assets and liabilities are *suddenly* alot larger, likewise with the income statement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It's not actually required for a business to disclose it's change in scope, however if it's something like a merger or acquisition, it would be quite remiss for the management to not discuss this in the management discussion and analysis, but not an actual requirement:\n",
    "\n",
    "HOWEVER: As an analyst - you must be aware.  So, hopegfully you will have found out this information from a variety of sources and it is something you need to consider from a comparability perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Exchange Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "* Overseas trade or overseas subsidiaries -- paying or invoicing customers in foreign currencies, or whole subsidiaries overseas.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You report in one currency only, so all sales and purchases must be converted into that  reporting currency.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Changes in exchange rates may have an impact, for example, the same units sold last year vs. this year and prices hasn't changed, but because of the exchange rate it's had a significant impact on your revenue or income once you convert them to your actual currency. **not required to be disclosed.**. but it's definately something for an analyst to be aware of and consider when analyzing and comparing financial statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Accounting standards do not require firms to disclose the impact on their financial statements of changes in scope or exchange rates, but analysts must be alert to their effects. In this context, \"changes in scope\" refer to how acquiring another company affects the size of the combined entity. Mergers and acquisitions can dramatically reduce comparability of company financial statements before and after the acquisition date. If a company conducts overseas trade or owns overseas subsidiaries, fluctuating exchange rates can affect its financial statements because overseas sales and purchases and the income statements of overseas subsidiaries need to be converted to the company's reporting currency. If a company conducts overseas trade or owns overseas subsidiaries, fluctuating exchange rates can affect its financial statements because overseas sales and purchases and the income statements of overseas subsidiaries need to be converted to the company's reporting currency.\n",
