    "\n",
    "The **cash flow statement** provides information for a reporting period beyond that available from the income statement, which is based on accrual, rather than cash, accounting. Analysts use cash flow statements to understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A company's cash receipts and cash payments during an accounting period\n",
    "* A company's operating, investing, and financing activities\n",
    "* The impact of accrual accounting events on cash flows\n",
    "* A company's quality of earnings\n",
    "\n",
    "An analyst can use the statement of cash flows to assess a firm's liquidity, solvency, and financial flexibility, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Whether regular operations generate enough cash to sustain the business\n",
    "* Whether the firm generates enough cash to pay off existing debts as they mature\n",
    "* Whether the firm is likely to need additional financing\n",
    "* Whether the firm can meet unexpected obligations\n",
    "* Whether the firm can take advantage of new business opportunities as they arise\n",
    "\n",
    "The cash flow statement reconciles the beginning and ending balances of cash in the balance sheet over an accounting period. The change in cash is a result of the firm's operating, investing, and financing activities, as follows:\n",

    "Earnings are considered to be of high quality when operating cash flows, which can also be called cash flow from operations (CFO), are close to or higher than reported earnings. If earnings are consistently higher than CFO, their quality is lower because the accruals-based earnings are not backed by cash creation from operating activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the statement of cash flows, the income statement is a \"flow\" statement (sometimes referred to as a dynamic statement), as it shows the company's performance between two balance sheet dates. However, due to the accruals concept, net income is not the same as cash generated by the company. In addition, many financing and investing cash flows do not affect the income statement at the time of the transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to the balance sheet, operating activities relate (with a few exceptions) to the firm's current assets and current liabilities. Investing activities typically relate to the firm's noncurrent assets, and financing activities typically relate to the firm's noncurrent liabilities and equity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transactions for which the timing of revenue or expense recognition differs from the receipt or payment of cash are reflected in changes in balance sheet accounts. For example, when revenues (sales) exceed cash collections, the firm has sold items on credit, and accounts receivable (an asset) increase. The opposite occurs if customers repay more on their outstanding accounts than the firm extends in new credit: cash collections exceed revenues, and accounts receivable decrease. Similarly, when purchases from suppliers exceed cash payments, accounts payable (a liability) increase. When cash payments exceed purchases, accounts payable decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is helpful to understand how transactions affect each balance sheet account. For example, accounts receivable are increased by sales on credit and decreased by cash collections. We can summarize this relationship as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "<thead>\n",

    "    <th></th>\n",
    "    <th>Beginning accounts receivable</th>\n",

    "    <td>Closing balance sheet</td>\n",
    "  </tr>\n",
    "</tbody>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing three of the four variables, we can solve for the fourth. For example, if beginning accounts receivable are €10,000, ending accounts receivable are €15,000, and sales are €68,000, then cash collections must equal €63,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "By rearranging this relationship, we can say that cash = sales – ending accounts receivable + beginning accounts receivable, or cash = sales – change in accounts receivable. Cash = €68,000 – (€15,000 – €10,000) = €63,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Revenue recognition standards affect when a sale is recorded in the income statement, but not the timing of cash flows from the customer. If a firm receives cash from a customer in advance of the sale being recorded in the income statement (unearned revenue), the cash received will appear in the cash flow statement at the time of payment, not when the sale is recorded. For example, if a company provided a service agreement to a customer, the cash received is reflected in the cash flow statement when the customer pays for the contract (normally in advance), but revenue recognized in the income statement is spread over the life of the contract.\n",

    "\n",
    "The direct method of presenting a firm's statement of cash flows shows only cash payments and cash receipts over the period. The sum of these inflows and outflows is CFO. The direct method gives an analyst more information than the indirect method (which we will explain later in this reading). The analyst can see the actual amounts that went to each use of cash and that were received from each source of cash. This information can help the analyst to better understand the firm's performance over time and to forecast future cash flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are common components that appear on a statement of cash flows presented using the direct method:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cash collected from customers (typically the main component of CFO)\n",
    "* Cash used in the production of goods and services (cash inputs)\n",
    "* Cash operating expenses, such as salaries\n",
    "* Cash paid for interest\n",
    "* Cash paid for taxes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These are steps for the direct method:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1: Start at the top of the income statement with revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 2: Examine the balance sheet for any assets or liabilities (typically current) relating to the income statement item.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 3: Compute the change in the balance sheet asset or liability.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 4: Adjust the income statement for the change in the balance sheet amount using the following rules:\n",
    "    * Subtract an increase in an asset (a use of cash), or add a decrease in an asset (a source of cash).\n",
    "    * Add an increase in a liability (a source of cash), or subtract a decrease in a liability\n",
    "   \n",
    "    For these rules to work consistently, we must treat expense items as negative numbers (e.g., cost of goods sold, wages and salaries) before we adjust them.\n",
    ".\n",
    "* Step 5: After adjusting the income statement item for the change in the balance sheet asset or liability, move to the next item in the income statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 6: Ignore any noncash charges (e.g., depreciation, gains and losses on asset disposal). A noncash charge is any amount in the income statement that is due to accounting treatment rather than actual cash flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 7: Once all income statement items have been adjusted for accruals, total the amount to get CFO.\n",
