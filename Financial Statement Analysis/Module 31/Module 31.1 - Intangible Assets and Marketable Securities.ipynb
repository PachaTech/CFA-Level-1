    "Intangible assets are nonmonetary assets that lack physical substance. Securities are not considered intangible assets. Intangible assets are either identifiable or unidentifiable. Identifiable intangible assets can be acquired separately or are the result of rights or privileges conveyed to their owner. Examples of identifiable intangibles are patents, trademarks, and copyrights. Unidentifiable intangible assets cannot be acquired separately and may have an unlimited life. The best example of an unidentifiable intangible asset is goodwill.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), identifiable intangibles that are purchased can be reported on the balance sheet using the cost model or the revaluation model, although the revaluation model can only be used if an active market for the intangible asset exists. Both models are basically the same as the measurement models used for property, plant, and equipment. Under U.S. GAAP, only the cost model is allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Except for certain legal costs, intangible assets that are created internally, such as research and development costs, are expensed as incurred under U.S. GAAP. Under IFRS, a firm must identify the research stage (discovery of new scientific or technical knowledge) and the development stage (using research results to plan or design products). The firm must expense costs incurred during the research stage but can capitalize costs incurred during the development stage. Criteria a project must meet for the firm to capitalize development costs include the following: the project is technically feasible, the resources exist to complete the project, a market exists for the product, and the company has the intention and resources to complete the project and sell the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and tested for impairment in the same way as PP&E. The firm must review its amortization method and useful life estimates at least annually. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but they are tested for impairment at least annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under IFRS and U.S. GAAP, all of the following should be expensed as incurred:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start-up and training costs\n",
    "* Administrative overhead\n",
    "* Advertising and promotion costs\n",
    "* Relocation and reorganization costs\n",
    "* Termination costs\n",
    "\n",
    "Some analysts choose to eliminate intangible assets when they evaluate balance sheets. However, analysts should consider the value to the firm of each intangible asset before making any adjustments."

    "Acquirers are often willing to pay more than the fair value of a target's identifiable net assets because the target may have assets that are not reported on its balance sheet. For example, the target's reputation and customer loyalty certainly have value, but that value is not quantifiable. Also, the target may have research and development assets that remain off the balance sheet because of accounting standards. Finally, part of the acquisition price may reflect perceived synergies from the business combination.

    "Because it is an intangible asset with indefinite life, goodwill is not amortized but must be tested for impairment at least annually. If goodwill is impaired, the company decreases its value and recognizes a loss in the income statement. The impairment loss does not affect cash flow. Goodwill impairment suggests an acquired business is now worth less than the price the company paid to acquire it, because the company has reduced its estimate of the future excess returns the acquired business is expected to generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Acquiring firms might try to take advantage of the fact that goodwill is not amortized, manipulating net income upward by allocating more of an acquisition price to goodwill and less to the identifiable assets, especially when fair value is subjective. Lower-valued identifiable assets result in less future depreciation and amortization expense, and therefore higher net income.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accounting goodwill should not be confused with **economic goodwill**. Economic goodwill derives from the expected future performance of the firm, while accounting goodwill is the result of past acquisitions.\n",

    "Some analysts believe goodwill represents the present value of excess returns that the acquired company is expected to contribute, and so it is a legitimate asset. Other analysts believe goodwill is not a genuine asset because it cannot be sold separately and might result from simply overpaying for an acquired company. Examining impairments of goodwill can be a way to judge how successful companies' past acquisitions have been.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Long-term financial liabilities** include bank loans, notes payable, bonds payable, and some derivatives. If the financial liabilities are not issued at face value, the liabilities are usually reported on the balance sheet at amortized cost. If the issuance value differs from face value, any premium or discount is amortized through interest expense over the life of the liability. Amortized cost at any point in the liability's life is equal to the issue price minus any principal payments, plus any amortized discount or minus any amortized premium. Amortizing premiums and discounts causes the balance sheet liability to move toward face value at maturity of the liability.\n",
    "\n",

Examples include held-for-trading liabilities such as a short position in a stock (which may be classified as a short-term liability), derivative liabilities, and nonderivative liabilities with exposures hedged by derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deferred tax liabilities** are income taxes payable in future periods as a result of timing differences between financial accounting and tax accounting. Deferred tax liabilities are created when the amount of income tax expense recognized in the income statement is greater than taxes payable using tax accounting. This can occur when expenses or losses are tax deductible before they are recognized in the income statement. A common example is when a firm uses an accelerated depreciation method for tax purposes and the straight-line method for financial reporting. Deferred tax liabilities are also created when revenues or gains are recognized in the income statement before they are taxable. For example, a firm often recognizes the earnings of a subsidiary before any distributions (dividends) are made. Eventually, deferred tax liabilities will reverse when the taxes are paid."
