    "### LOS 91.b: Recommend practices and procedures designed to prevent violations of the Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct.\n",
    "### LOS 91.c: Identify conduct that conforms to the Code and Standards and conduct that violates the Code and Standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Standards of Professional Conduct comprise seven Standards (I–VII) and a total of 22 subsections. These Standards and their application are described in the Standards of Practice Handbook, 11th Edition, 2014, published by CFA Institute.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Standards of Practice Handbook is included in its entirety in the CFA curriculum in Volume 6. You can also download a PDF of the *Standards of Practice Handbook* at the website for CFA Institute, www.cfainstitute.org. A third alternative is to purchase *the Standards of Practice Handbook* through Amazon (make sure you get the 11th edition) for about \\\\$40 or get the Kindle edition for \\\\$0.99.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Professor's Note**\n",
    "\\\n",
    "You should carefully read the  *Standards of Practice Handbook* multiple times in preparation for your Level I exam (yes, the entire book, including all examples). **Fifteen to twenty percent** of your exam questions will be based on this book and the short learning module concerning Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS). Given that much of this material must simply be memorized, we suggest that your final reading of the  *Standards of Practice Handbook* be on the Friday prior to your exam. You probably do not need to read all the examples that day, but if you highlighted some points during an earlier reading, you can revisit those as you go through all the Standards, the guidance, and the recommended best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our summary of the Standards of Practice, we focus on describing three things: \n",
    "(1) actions that clearly violate the subsection, \n",
    "(2) the behaviors that each subsection is intended to either encourage or discourage, and \n",
    "(3) recommended best practices for members and their firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases the actions that members and candidates must not take are explained using terms open to interpretation, such as \"reasonable,\" \"adequate,\" and \"token.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples from the Standards themselves are:\n",
    "* use reasonable care and judgment to achieve…\n",
    "* accept any gift, that reasonably could be expected to compromise…\n",
    "* act with reasonable care and exercise prudent judgment…\n",
    "* deal fairly and objectively with all clients\n",
    "* make a reasonable inquiry into…\n",
    "* make reasonable efforts to ensure…\n",
    "* might reasonably be expected to create a conflict of interest with…\n",
    "* Have a reasonable and adequate basis…\n",
    "* Use reasonable judgment in…\n",
    "* matters that could be reasonably expected to impair…\n",
    "\n",
    "The requirement of the LOS is that you know what constitutes a violation, not that you draw a distinction between what is \"reasonable\" and what is not in a given situation. We believe the exam writers take this into account and that if they intend, for example, to test whether a recommendation has been given without reasonable care and judgment, it will likely be clear either that the care and judgment exhibited by the analyst did not rise to the level of \"reasonable,\" or that it did.\n",
    "\n",
    "No monetary value for a \"token\" gift is given in the Standards, although it is recommended that a firm establish such a monetary value for its employees. Here, again, the correct answer to a question will not likely hinge on candidate's determination of what is a token gift and what is not. Questions should be clear in this regard. A business dinner is likely a token gift, but a week at a condominium in Aspen or tickets to the Super Bowl are likely not. Always look for clues in the questions that lead you to the question-writer's preferred answer choice, such as \"lavish\" entertainment and \"luxury\" accommodations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we present a summary of each subsection of the Standards of Professional Conduct. For each one, we first detail actions that violate the Standard and then list actions and behaviors that are recommended within the Standards. We suggest you learn the violations especially well so you understand that the other items are recommended. For the exam, it is not necessary to memorize the Standard number and subsection letter. Knowing that an action violates, for example, Professionalism, rather than Duties to Employers or Duties to Clients, should be sufficient in this regard. Note that some actions may violate more than one Standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to write questions for this material is to offer a reason that might make one believe a Standard does not apply in a particular situation. In most, if not all, cases the \"reason\" does not change the requirement of the Standard. If you are prohibited from some action, the motivations for the action or other circumstances simply do not matter. If the Standard says it's a violation, it's a violation. An exception is when intent is key to the Standard, such as intending to mislead clients or market participants in general.\n",

    "## Standard I: Professionalism$^1$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard I(A) Knowledge of the Law\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"color:blue\">Members and Candidates must understand and comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations (including the CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct) of any government, regulatory organization, licensing agency, or professional association governing their professional activities. In the event of conflict, Members and Candidates must comply with the more strict law, rule, or regulation. Members and Candidates must not knowingly participate or assist in and must dissociate from any violation of such laws, rules, or regulations.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Standards begin with a straightforward statement: Don't violate any laws, rules, or regulations that apply to your professional activities. This includes the Code and Standards, so any violation of the Code and Standards will also violate this subsection.\n",
    "\n",
    "A member may be governed by different rules and regulations among the Standards, the country in which the member resides, and the country where the member is doing business. Follow the most strict of these, or, put another way, do not violate any of the three sets of rules and regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you know that violations of applicable rules or laws are taking place, either by coworkers or clients, CFA Institute strongly encourages members and candidates to report potential violations.2 One way to do so is to approach your supervisor or compliance department to remedy the situation. If they will not or cannot, then you must dissociate from the activity (e.g., not working with a trading group you know is not allocating client trades properly according to the Standard on Fair Dealing, or not using marketing materials that you know or should know are misleading or erroneous). If this cannot be accomplished, you may, in an extreme case, have to resign from the firm to be in compliance with this Standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommendations for Members\n",
    "\n",
    "* Establish, or encourage employer to establish, procedures to keep employees informed of changes in relevant laws, rules, and regulations.\n",
    "* Review, or encourage employer to review, the firm's written compliance procedures on a regular basis.\n",
    "* Maintain, or encourage employer to maintain, copies of current laws, rules, and regulations.\n",
    "* When in doubt about legality, consult supervisor, compliance personnel, or a lawyer.\n",
    "* When dissociating from violations, keep records documenting the violations, encourage employer to bring an end to the violations.\n",
    "* There is no requirement in the Standards to report wrongdoers, but local law may require it; members are \"strongly encouraged\" to report violations to CFA Institute Professional Conduct Program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommendations for Firms\n",
    "\n",
    "* Have a code of ethics.\n",
    "* Provide employees with information on laws, rules, and regulations governing professional activities.\n",
    "* Have procedures for reporting suspected violations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard I(B) Independence and Objectivity\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"color:blue\">Members and Candidates must use reasonable care and judgment to achieve and maintain independence and objectivity in their professional activities. Members and Candidates must not offer, solicit, or accept any gift, benefit, compensation, or consideration that reasonably could be expected to compromise their own or another's independence and objectivity.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysts may face pressure or receive inducements to give a security a specific rating, to select certain outside managers or vendors, or to produce favorable or unfavorable research and conclusions. Members who allow their investment recommendations or analysis to be influenced by such pressure or inducements will have violated the requirement to use reasonable care and to maintain independence and objectivity in their professional activities. Allocating shares in oversubscribed IPOs to personal accounts is a violation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal business entertainment is permitted. Members who accept, solicit, or offer things of value that could be expected to influence the member's or others' independence or objectivity are violating the Standard. Gifts from clients are considered less likely to compromise independence and objectivity than gifts from other parties. Client gifts must be disclosed to the member's employer prior to acceptance, if possible, but after acceptance, if not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Members may prepare reports paid for by the subject firm if compensation is a flat rate not tied to the conclusions of the report (and if the fact that the research is issuer-paid is disclosed). Accepting compensation that is dependent on the conclusions, recommendations, or market impact of the report, and failure to disclose that research is issuer-paid, are violations of this Standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommendations for Members\n",
    "\n",
    "Members or their firms should pay for their own travel to company events or tours when practicable and limit use of corporate aircraft to trips for which commercial travel is not an alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommendations for Firms\n",
    "* Restrict employee participation in IPOs and private placements; require pre-approval for participation.\n",
    "* Appoint a compliance officer, have written policies on independence and objectivity and clear procedures for reporting violations.\n",
    "* Limit gifts, other than from clients, to token items only.\n",

    "Misrepresentation includes knowingly misleading investors, omitting relevant information, presenting selective data to mislead investors, and plagiarism. Plagiarism is using reports, forecasts, models, ideas, charts, graphs, or spreadsheets created by others without crediting the source. Crediting the source is not required when using projections, statistics, and tables from recognized financial and statistical reporting services. When using models developed or research done by other members of the firm, it is permitted to omit the names of those who are no longer with the firm as long as the member does not represent work previously done by others as his alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actions that would violate the Standard include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Presenting third-party research as your own, without attribution to the source.\n",
    "* Guaranteeing a specific return on securities that do not have an explicit guarantee from a government body or financial institution.\n",
    "* Selecting a valuation service because it puts the highest value on untraded security holdings.\n",
    "* Selecting a performance benchmark that is not comparable to the investment strategy employed.\n",
    "* Presenting performance data or attribution analysis that omits accounts or relevant variables.\n",
    "* Offering false or misleading information about the analyst's or firm's capabilities, expertise, or experience.\n",
    "* Using marketing materials from a third party (outside advisor) that are misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations for Members\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prepare a summary of experience, qualifications, and services a member is able to perform.\n",
    "* Encourage employers to develop procedures for verifying marketing materials provided by third parties concerning their capabilities, products, and services.\n",
    "* Cite the source of any summaries of materials provided by others.\n",
    "* Keep copies of all reports, articles, or other materials used in the preparation of research reports.\n",

    "## Standard I(D) Misconduct\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"color:blue\">Members and Candidates must not engage in any professional conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, or deceit or commit any act that reflects adversely on their professional reputation, integrity, or competence.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part here regarding professional conduct is clear: no dishonesty, fraud, or deceit. The second part, while it applies to all conduct by the member, specifically requires that the act, \"reflects adversely on their professional reputation, integrity, or competence.\" The guidance states, in fact, that members must not try to use enforcement of this Standard against another member to settle personal, political, or other disputes that are not related to professional ethics or competence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations for Firms\n",
    "\n",
    "* Develop and adopt a code of ethics and make clear that unethical behavior will not be tolerated.\n",

    "\n",
    "Information is \"nonpublic\" until it has been made available to the marketplace. An analyst conference call is not public disclosure. Selective disclosure of information by corporations creates the potential for insider-trading violations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prohibition against acting on material nonpublic information extends to mutual funds containing the subject securities as well as related swaps and options contracts. It is the member's responsibility to determine if information she receives has been publicly disseminated prior acting or causing others to act on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some members and candidates may be involved in transactions during which they are provided with material nonpublic information by firms (e.g., investment banking transactions). Members and candidates may use this information for its intended purpose, but must not use the information for any other purpose unless it becomes public information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the so-called mosaic theory, reaching an investment conclusion through perceptive analysis of public information combined with non-material nonpublic information is not a violation of the Standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommendations for Members\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make reasonable efforts to achieve public dissemination by the firm of information they possess.\n",
    "* Encourage their firms to adopt procedures to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information.\n",

    "* Exercise substantial control of relevant interdepartmental communications through a clearance area, such as the compliance or legal department.\n",
    "* Review employee trades.\n",
    "* Maintain \"watch,\" \"restricted,\" and \"rumor\" lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitor and restrict proprietary trading while a firm is in possession of material nonpublic information. However, prohibiting all proprietary trading while a firm is in possession of material nonpublic information may be inappropriate because it may send a signal to the market. In these cases, firms should only take the opposite side of unsolicited customer trades.\n",

    "Members and Candidates must not engage in practices that distort prices or artificially inflate trading volume with the intent to mislead market participants.\n",

    "Member actions may affect security values and trading volumes without violating this Standard. The key point here is that if there is the intent to mislead, then the Standard is violated.

    "**Question 1:** \\\n",
    "Daniel Lyons, CFA, is an analyst who covers several stocks including Horizon Company. Lyons's aunt owns 30,000 shares of Horizon. She informs Lyons that she has created a trust in his name into which she has placed 2,000 shares of Horizon. The trust is structured so that Lyons will not be able to sell the shares until his aunt dies, but may vote the shares. Lyons is due to update his research coverage of Horizon next week. Lyons should *most appropriately*:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \\\n",
    "disclose the situation to his employer and, if then asked to prepare a report, also disclose his beneficial ownership of the shares in his report.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** \\\n",
    "Even though the shares are held in trust, Lyons is considered a beneficial owner under Standard VI(A) Disclosure of Conflicts because he has a pecuniary interest in the shares and because has the power to vote the shares. Lyons is obligated to inform his employer of the potential conflict. If Lyons's employer permits him to continue issuing investment recommendations on the company, Lyons must disclose the existence of a potential conflict in his reports. \n",

    "Kate Wilson, CFA, is an equity analyst. Wilson enters two transactions for her personal account. Wilson sells 500 shares of Tibon, Inc., a stock on which her firm currently has a \"Buy\" recommendation. Wilson buys 200 shares of Hayfield Co. and the following day issues a research report on Hayfield with a \"Buy\" recommendation. Has Wilson violated the Code and Standards?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \\\n",
    "Yes, but only one of her actions violates the Code and Standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** \\\n",
    "Only one of these transactions is a violation. Standard VI(B) Priority of Transactions requires members and candidates to give clients an adequate opportunity to act on a recommendation before trading for accounts in which the member or candidate has a beneficial ownership interest. Members and candidates may trade for their own accounts as long as they do not disadvantage clients, benefit personally from client trades, or violate any regulations that apply. The Standard does not prohibit members and candidates from entering personal transactions that are contrary to what their firms are recommending for clients, as long as the transaction does not violate any of these criteria. \n",

    "Hern Investments provides monthly emerging market research to Baker Brokerage in exchange for prospective client referrals and European equity research from Baker. Clients and prospects of Hern are not made aware of the agreement, but clients unanimously rave about the high quality of the research provided by Baker. As a result of the research, many clients with nondiscretionary accounts have earned substantial returns on their portfolios. Managers at Hern have also used the research to earn outstanding returns for the firm's discretionary accounts. Hern *has most likely*:\n",

    "After writing the Level I CFA exam, Cynthia White goes to internet discussion site *CFA Haven* to express her frustration.

Concise factual descriptions of the requirements to obtain the CFA charter are acceptable. Osgood's statement that she passed the exams on her first attempts is acceptable because it states a fact. \n",
