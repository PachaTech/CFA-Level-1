    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A member violates the Standard by accepting the title of chief compliance officer even though she has no experience in compliance, is denied permission to contact clients or review client communications, and is not allowed to enforce company policies.

    "\n",
    "A member enters client trades grouped as block orders and allocates them to specific client accounts after the market closes for the day.
