    "In contrast to valuing risky assets as the (risk-adjusted) present value of expected future cash flows, the valuation of derivative securities is based on a **no-arbitrage condition**. *Arbitrage* refers to a transaction in which an investor purchases one asset or portfolio of assets at one price and simultaneously sells an asset or portfolio of assets that has the same future payoffs, regardless of future events, at a higher price, realizing a risk-free gain on the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "While arbitrage opportunities may be rare, the reasoning is that when they do exist, they will be exploited rapidly. Therefore, we can use a no-arbitrage condition to determine the current value of a derivative, based on the known value of a portfolio of assets that has the same future payoffs as the derivative, regardless of future events. Because there are transaction costs of exploiting an arbitrage opportunity, small differences in price may persist when the arbitrage gain is less than the transaction costs of exploiting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can illustrate no-arbitrage pricing with a 1-year forward contract, with a forward price of $F_0(1)$, on an Acme share that pays no dividends and is trading at a current price, $S_0$, of \\$30.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two strategies to own an Acme share at $t=1$:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Portfolio 1*: Buy a pure discount bond with a yield of 5\\% that pays $F_0(1)$ at $t = 1$. The current cost of the bond is $F_0(1) \\div 1.05$. Additionally, enter a forward contract on one Acme share at $F_0(1)$ as the buyer. The forward has a zero cost, so the cost of Portfolio 1 is $F_0(1) \\div 1.05$.\n",
    "\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "At $t = 1$ the bond pays $F_0(1)$, which will buy an Acme share at the forward price, so that the payoff on Portfolio 1 is the value of one share at $t = 1$, $S_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\\n",
    "* *Portfolio 2*: Buy a share of Acme at $S_0 = 30$ and hold it for one year. Cost at $t = 0$ is $\\$30$.\n",

    "The no-arbitrage condition (law of one price) requires that two portfolios with the same payoff in the future for any future value of Acme have the same cost today. Because our two portfolios have a payoff of $S_1$, they must have the same cost at $t = 0$ to prevent arbitrage. That is, $F_0(1) \\div 1.05 = \\$30$, so we can solve for the no-arbitrage forward price as $F_0(1) = 30(1.05) = 31.50$.\n",

    "To better understand the no-arbitrage condition, we will consider two situations in which the forward price is not at its no-arbitrage value: $F_0(1) > 31.50$ and $F_0(1) < 31.50$.\n",

At $t = 1$, deliver the share under the forward contract and receive $32$, for a return of $32/30 – 1 = 6.67\\%$, which is higher than the risk-free rate.\n",

    "We can also view this transaction as borrowing $30$ at the risk-free rate $(5\\%)$ to buy the Acme share at $t = 0$ and at $t = 1$ paying $31.50$ to settle the loan.

The proceeds of the short sale, $30$, can be invested at the risk-free rate to produce $30x(1.05) = 31.50$ at $t = 1$. The forward contract requires the purchase of a share of Acme for $31$, which the investor can return to close out the short position. The profit to an arbitrageur is $31.50 – 31 = 0.50$. With no cash investment at $t = 0$, the investor receives an arbitrage profit of $0.50$ at $t = 1$.\n",

    "When we derived the no-arbitrage forward price for an asset as $F_0(T) = S_0(1 + Rf)T$, we assumed there were no benefits of holding the asset and no costs of holding the asset, other than the opportunity cost of the funds to purchase the asset (the risk-free rate of interest).\n",

There may be additional costs of owning an asset, especially with commodities, such as storage and insurance costs. For financial assets, these costs are very low and not significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "There may also be monetary benefits to holding an asset, such as dividend payments for equities and interest payments for debt instruments. Holding commodities may have non-monetary benefits, referred to as **convenience yield**. If an asset is difficult to sell short in the market, owning it may convey benefits in circumstances where selling the asset is advantageous. For example, a shortage of the asset may drive prices up temporarily, making sale of the asset in the short term profitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We denote the present value of any costs of holding the asset from time 0 to settlement at time $T$ (e.g., storage, insurance, spoilage) as $PV_0$(cost), and the present value of any cash flows from the asset or convenience yield over the holding period as $PV_0$(benefit).\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider first a case where there are storage costs of holding the asset, but no benefits. For an asset with no costs or benefits of holding the asset, we established the no-arbitrage forward price as $S_0(1 + R_f)T$, the cost of buying and holding the underlying asset until time $T$. When there are storage costs to hold the asset until time $T$, an arbitrageur must both buy the asset and pay the present value of storage costs at $t = 0$. This increases the no-arbitrage price of a 1-year forward to $[S_0+ PV_0(\\text{cost})](1 + R_f)T$. Here we see that costs of holding an asset increase its no-arbitrage forward price.\n",

Returning to our example of a 1-year forward on a share of Acme stock trading at 30, now consider the costs of buying and holding an Acme share that pays a dividend of $\\$1$ during the life of the forward contract. In this case, an arbitrageur can now borrow the present value of the dividend (discounted at $R_f$), and repay that loan when the dividend is received. The cost to buy and hold Acme stock with an annual dividend of $\\$1$  is $[30 – PV_0(1)](1.05) = 30(1.05) – 1$. \n",
