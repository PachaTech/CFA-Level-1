With options, however, the initial values of options are positive; the buyer pays a premium (the option price) to the writer (seller). Another difference is that where forward commitments have essentially unlimited gains or losses for both parties (except to the extent that prices are constrained by zero), options are one-sided: Potential losses for the buyer, and potential gains for the writer, are limited to the premium paid. For these reasons, the no-arbitrage approach we use for pricing contingent claims is different from the model we use for forward commitments.\n",

    "### LOS 75.c: Identify the factors that determine the value of an option and describe how each factor affects the value of an option.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are six factors that determine option prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Price of the underlying asset**. For call options, the higher the price of the underlying, the greater its exercise value and the higher the value of the option. Conversely, the lower the price of the underlying, the less its exercise value and the lower the value of the call option. In general, call option values increase when the value of the underlying asset increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "For put options this relationship is reversed. An increase in the price of the underlying reduces the value of a put option.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The exercise price**. A higher exercise price decreases the values of call options and a lower exercise price increases the values of call options.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A higher exercise price increases the values of put options and a lower exercise price decreases the values of put options.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The risk-free rate of interest**. An increase in the risk-free rate will increase call option values, and a decrease in the risk-free rate will decrease call option values.\n",
    "\n",
    "An increase in the risk-free rate will decrease put option values, and a decrease in the risk-free rate will increase put option values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Professor's Note**\n",
    "\\\n",
    "One way to remember the effects of changes in the risk-free rate is to think about present values of the payments for calls and puts. These statements are strictly true only for in-the-money options, but it's a way to remember the relationships. The holder of a call option will pay in the future to exercise a call option and the present value of that payment is lower when the risk-free rate is higher, so a higher risk-free rate increases a call option's value. The holder of a put option will receive a payment in the future when the put is exercised and an increase in the risk-free rate decreases the present value of this payment, so a higher risk-free rate decreases a put option's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Time to expiration**. Because volatility is expressed per unit of time, longer time to expiration effectively increases expected volatility and increases the value of a call option. Less time to expiration decreases the time value of a call option so that at expiration its value is simply its exercise value. For most put options, longer time to expiration will increase option values for the same reasons. For some European put options, however, extending the time to expiration can decrease the value of the put. In general, the deeper a put option is in the money, the higher the risk-free rate, and the longer the current time to expiration, the more likely that extending the option's time to expiration will decrease its value.  To understand this possibility consider a put option at €20 on a stock with a value that has decreased to €1. The exercise value of the put is €19 so the upside is very limited, the downside (if the price of the underlying subsequently increases) is significant, and because no payment will be received until the expiration date, the current option value reflects the present value of any expected payment. Extending the time to expiration would decrease that present value. While overall we expect a longer time to expiration to increase the value of a European put option, in the case of a deep in-the-money put, a longer time to expiration could decrease its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Costs and benefits of holding the asset**. If there are benefits of holding the underlying asset (dividend or interest payments on securities or a convenience yield on commodities), call values are decreased and put values are increased. The reason for this is most easily understood by considering cash benefits. When a stock pays a dividend, or a bond pays interest, this reduces the value of the asset. Decreases in the value of the underlying asset decrease call values and increase put values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive storage costs make it more costly to hold an asset. We can think of this as making a call option more valuable because call holders can have long exposure to the asset without paying the costs of actually owning the asset. Puts, on the other hand, are less valuable when storage costs are higher.\n",
