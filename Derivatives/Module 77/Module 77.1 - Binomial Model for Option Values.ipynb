    "Recall from <u>Quantitative Methods</u> that a **binomial model** is based on the idea that, over the next period, some value will change to one of two possible values (binomial). To construct a one-period binomial model for pricing an option, we need:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A value for the underlying at the beginning of the period.\n",
    "* An exercise price for the option. The exercise price can be different from the value of the underlying. We assume the option expires one period from now.\n",
    "* Returns that will result from an up-move and a down-move in the value of the underlying over one period.\n",
    "* The risk-free rate over the period.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now we do not need to consider the probabilities of an up-move or a down-move. Later in this reading we will examine one-period binomial models with risk-neutral probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we can model a call option with an exercise price of ‚Ç¨55 on a stock that is currently valued $(S_0)$ at ‚Ç¨50. Let us assume that in one period the stock's value will either increase $(S^u_1)$ to ‚Ç¨60 or decrease $(S^d_1)$ to ‚Ç¨42. We state the return from an up-move $(R^u)$ as ‚Ç¨60/‚Ç¨50 = 1.20, and the return from a down-move $(R^d)$ as ‚Ç¨42/‚Ç¨50 = 0.84."

Remember, the risk-neutral probabilities come from constructing a hedge that creates a certain payoff. Because their calculation is based on an arbitrage relationship, we can discount the expected payoff based on risk-neutral probabilities, using the risk-free rate.\n",
