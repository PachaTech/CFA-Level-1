    "\n",
    "Recall from <u>Quantitative Methods</u> that a **binomial model** is based on the idea that, over the next period, some value will change to one of two possible values (binomial). To construct a one-period binomial model for pricing an option, we need:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A value for the underlying at the beginning of the period.\n",
    "* An exercise price for the option. The exercise price can be different from the value of the underlying. We assume the option expires one period from now.\n",
    "* Returns that will result from an up-move and a down-move in the value of the underlying over one period.\n",
    "* The risk-free rate over the period.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now we do not need to consider the probabilities of an up-move or a down-move. Later in this reading we will examine one-period binomial models with risk-neutral probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we can model a call option with an exercise price of ‚Ç¨55 on a stock that is currently valued $(S_0)$ at ‚Ç¨50. Let us assume that in one period the stock's value will either increase $(S^u_1)$ to ‚Ç¨60 or decrease $(S^d_1)$ to ‚Ç¨42. We state the return from an up-move $(R^u)$ as ‚Ç¨60/‚Ç¨50 = 1.20, and the return from a down-move $(R^d)$ as ‚Ç¨42/‚Ç¨50 = 0.84."

    "\n",
    "Now we can use no-arbitrage pricing to determine the initial value of the call option $(c_0)$. We do this by creating a portfolio of the option and the underlying stock, such that the portfolio will have the same value following either an up-move ($V^u_1$) or a down-move ($V^d_1$) in the stock. For our example, we would write the call option and buy a number of shares of the stock that we will denote as $h$. We must solve for the $h$ that results in $V^u_1= V^d_1$.\n",
