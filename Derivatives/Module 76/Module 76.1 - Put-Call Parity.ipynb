The payoff for a fiduciary call at expiration is $X$ when the call is out of the money, and $X + (S − X) = S$ when the call is in the money.\n",

At contract initiation the forward contract has zero value. At time $T$, when the forward contract settles, the long must purchase the asset for $F_0(T)$. The purchase (at time $= 0$) of a pure discount bond that will pay $F_0(T)$ at maturity (time = $T$) will cost $F_0(T)(1 + R_f)^{–T}$.\n",

At time = $T$ the proceeds of the bond are just sufficient to purchase the asset as required by the long forward position. Because there is no cost to enter into the forward contract, the total cost of the synthetic asset is the present value of the forward price, $F_0(T)(1 + R_f)^{–T}$.\n",
