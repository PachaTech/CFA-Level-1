    "### LOS 73.b: Explain why forward and futures prices differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "For pricing, the most important distinction between futures and forwards is that with futures, mark-to market gains and losses are paid each day. Gains above initial margin can be withdrawn from a futures account and losses that reduce margin deposits below their maintenance level require payments into the account. Forwards most often have no mark-to-market cash flows, with gains or losses settled at contract expiration. Forwards typically do not require or provide funds in response to fluctuations in value during their lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "If interest rates are constant or uncorrelated with futures prices over time, the prices of futures and forwards are the same. A positive correlation between interest rates and the futures price means that (for a long position) daily settlement provides funds (excess margin) when rates are high and they can earn more interest, and requires funds (margin deposits) when rates are low and opportunity cost of deposited funds is less. Because of this, futures are theoretically more attractive than forwards when interest rates and futures prices are positively correlated, and less attractive than forwards when interest rates and futures prices are negatively correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the short maturity of most forwards and the availability of funds at near risk-free rates, differences between equivalent forwards and futures are not observed in practice. Additionally, derivative dealers in some markets with central clearing are required to post margin and may require derivative investors to post mark-to-market margin payments as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "A separate issue arises for interest rate forwards and futures settlement payments. Recall that the payoff on an interest rate forward is the present value (at the beginning of the forward period) of any interest savings (at the end of the forward period) from the difference between the realized MRR and the forward MRR. Because the realized MRR is the discount rate for calculating the payment for a given amount of future interest savings, the payment for an increase in the MRR will be less than the payment for an equal decrease in the MRR, as the following example will illustrate.\n",

Each basis point change in the (annualized) MRR will change the value of the contract by 0.0001 × 6/12 × €1 million = €50. If the MRR at settlement is either 2.51\\% or 2.49\\%, the payoff on the future at the end of one year is either €50 higher or €50 lower than when the MRR at settlement is 2.5\\%.\n"

    "The value of the forwards exhibit convexity. An increase in rates decreases the forward's value by less than a decrease in the interest rate increases the forward's value, just as we saw with bonds. Also just as with bonds, the convexity effect for the value of forwards increases for longer periods. The convexity of forwards is termed convexity bias and forwards and futures prices can be significantly different for longer-term interest rates.\n",
