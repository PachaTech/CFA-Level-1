A trimmed mean excludes a stated percentage of the most extreme observations. A 1% trimmed mean, for example, would discard the lowest 0.5% and the highest 0.5% of the observations. To compute a winsorized mean, instead of discarding the highest and lowest observations, we substitute a value for them. To calculate a 90% winsorized mean, for example, we would determine the 5th and 95th percentile of the observations, substitute the 5th percentile for any values lower than that, substitute the 95th percentile for any values higher than that, and then calculate the mean of the revised dataset.\n",
