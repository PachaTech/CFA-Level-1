    "Understanding time value of money (TVM) computations is essential for success, not only for quantitative methods, but also other sections of the Level I exam. Candidates who are unfamiliar with TVM calculations, or simply need a refresher, should review them in the CFA Institute prerequisite material for Quantitative Methods. TVM is actually a larger portion of the exam than just quantitative methods because of its integration with other topics. Any portion of the exam that requires discounting cash flows will require TVM calculations. Examples include evaluating capital projects, valuing bonds, and using dividend discount models to value equities. No matter where it shows up on the exam, the key to any TVM problem is to draw a timeline and be certain of when the cash flows will occur so you can discount those cash flows appropriately.\n",

When a distribution has one value that appears most frequently, it is said to be **unimodal**.
