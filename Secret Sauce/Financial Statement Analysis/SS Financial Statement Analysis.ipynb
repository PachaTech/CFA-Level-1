    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial reporting refers to the way companies show their financial performance to investors, creditors, and other interested parties by preparing and presenting financial statements. The role of financial statement analysis is to use the information in a company's financial statements, along with other relevant information, to make economic decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **financial statement analysis framework$^1$** consists of six steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 1*: State the objective and context.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 2*: Gather data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 3*: Process the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 4*: Analyze and interpret the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 5*: Report the conclusions or recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 6*: Update the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Standard-setting bodies** are professional organizations of accountants and auditors that establish financial reporting standards. **Regulatory authorities** are government agencies that have the legal authority to enforce compliance with financial reporting standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two primary standard-setting bodies are the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). In the United States, the FASB sets forth the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP). Outside the United States, the IASB establishes the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Regulatory authorities, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the United Kingdom, are established by national governments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most national authorities belong to the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). IOSCO is not a regulatory body, but its members work together to improve cross-border cooperation and make national regulations and enforcement more uniform around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "SEC-required filings include <u>Form 8-K</u>, which a company must file to report events, such as acquisitions and disposals of major assets or changes in its management or corporate governance. Companies' annual and quarterly financial statements are also filed with the SEC (<u>Form 10-K</u> and <u>Form 10-Q</u>, respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Financial statement notes (footnotes)** include disclosures that provide further details about the information summarized in the financial statements. Footnotes allow users to improve their assessments of the amount, timing, and uncertainty of the estimates reported in the financial statements. Footnotes do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* They provide information about accounting methods, assumptions, and estimates used by management.\n",
    "* They are audited, whereas other disclosures, such as supplementary schedules, are not audited.\n",
    "* They provide additional information on such items as business acquisitions or disposals, legal actions, employee benefit plans, contingencies and commitments, significant customers, related-party transactions, position and performance of segments of the firm, and significant post-balance-sheet events.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A **business segment** or **operating segment** is a portion of a larger company that accounts for more than 10% of the company's revenues, assets, or income. Both U.S. GAAP and IFRS require companies to report segment data, but the required disclosure items are only a subset of the required disclosures for the company as a whole. **Geographic segments** are also identified when they both meet the size criterion and have a business environment that is different from that of other segments or the remainder of the company's business.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Management commentary**, or **management discussion and analysis (MD&A)**, provides an assessment of the financial performance and condition of a company from the perspective of its management. For publicly held companies in the United States, the MD&A is required to discuss the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Trends, significant events, and uncertainties that affect the firm\n",
    "* Effects of inflation and changing prices, if material\n",
    "* Impact of off-balance-sheet and contractual obligations\n",
    "* Accounting policies that require significant judgment by management\n",
    "* Forward-looking expenditures and divestitures\n",
    "\n",
    "### Audit Reports\n",
    "\n",
    "An **audit** is an independent review of an entity's financial statements. Public accountants conduct audits and examine the financial reports and supporting records. The objective of an audit is to enable the auditor to provide an opinion on the fairness and reliability of the financial reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "The independent certified public accounting firm employed by the board of directors is responsible for seeing that the financial statements conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The auditor examines the company's accounting and internal control systems, confirms assets and liabilities, and generally tries to be confident that there are no material errors in the financial statements and that they conform to applicable reporting standards. The auditor's report is an important source of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **standard auditor's opinion** contains three parts, stating the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Whereas the financial statements are prepared by management and are its responsibility, the auditor has performed an independent review.\n",
    "2. Generally accepted auditing standards were followed, thus providing reasonable assurance that the financial statements contain no material errors.\n",
    "3. The auditor is satisfied that the statements were prepared in accordance with accepted accounting principles and that the accounting principles chosen and estimates made are reasonable. The auditor's report must also contain additional explanation when accounting methods have not been used consistently between periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "An *unqualified opinion* (also known as an unmodified opinion or clean opinion) indicates that the auditor believes the statements are free from material omissions and errors. If the statements make any exceptions to the accounting principles, the auditor may issue a *qualified opinion* and explain these exceptions in the audit report. The auditor can issue an adverse opinion if the statements are not presented fairly or are materially nonconforming with accounting standards, or a *disclaimer of opinion* if the auditor is unable to express an opinion. Any opinion other than unqualified is sometimes referred to as a *modified opinion*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The auditor's opinion will also contain an explanatory paragraph when a material loss is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated. These uncertainties may relate to the *going concern assumption* (the firm will continue to operate for the foreseeable future), to the valuation or realization of assets, or to litigation. This type of disclosure may be a signal of serious problems and call for closer examination by the analyst. An audit report must also include a section called *key audit matters* (international reports) or *critical audit matters* (United States), which highlights accounting choices that are of greatest significance to users of financial statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under U.S. GAAP, the auditor must state an opinion on a publicly traded company's **internal controls**, the processes by which the company ensures that it presents accurate financial statements. Internal controls are the responsibility of the firm's management. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management is required to provide a report on the company's internal control system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Information Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proxy statements** are issued to shareholders when there are matters that require a shareholder vote. These statements, which are also filed with the SEC and available from EDGAR, are a good source of information about the election of (and qualifications of) board members, compensation, management qualifications, and the issuance of stock options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Corporate reports and press releases are written by management and are often viewed as public relations or sales materials. Not all of the material is independently reviewed by outside auditors. Such information can often be found on the company's website. Management may also provide **earnings guidance** to analysts before releasing the firm's financial statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "An analyst should review information on economic conditions and the company's industry and compare the company to its competitors. This information can be acquired from sources such as trade journals, statistical reporting services, and government agencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences Between IFRS and U.S. GAAP\n",
    "\n",
    "While the IASB and FASB work together to harmonize changes to accounting standards, some significant differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP still exist. The following table lists some of the most significant differences.\n",

    "As financial reporting standards continue to evolve, analysts need to monitor how these developments will affect the financial statements they use. An analyst should be aware of new products and innovations in the financial markets that generate new types of transactions. These might not fall neatly into the existing financial reporting standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep up to date on the evolving standards, an analyst can monitor professional journals and other sources, such as the IASB and FASB websites. CFA Institute produces position papers on financial reporting issues through the CFA Centre for Financial Market Integrity.\n",

    "### Revenue Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sale where the goods are exchanged for cash and returns are not allowed, the recognition of revenue is straightforward: it is recognized at the time of the exchange. The recognition of revenue is not, however, dependent on receiving cash payment. If a sale of goods is made on credit, revenue can be recognized at the time of sale—and an asset, **accounts receivable**, is created on the balance sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "If payment for the goods is received before the transfer of the good, a liability, **unearned revenue**, is created when the cash is received (offsetting the increase in the asset *cash*). Revenue is recognized as the goods are transferred to the buyer. As an example, consider a magazine subscription. When the subscription is purchased, an unearned revenue liability is created—and as magazine issues are delivered, revenue is recorded and the liability is decreased.\n",
    "\n",
    "Converged standards under IFRS and U.S. GAAP take a principles-based approach to revenue recognition issues. The central principle is that a firm should recognize revenue when it has transferred a good or service to a customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The converged standards identify a five-step process$^1$ for recognizing revenue:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 1*: Identify the contract(s) with a customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 2*: Identify the separate or distinct performance obligations in the contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 3*: Determine the transaction price.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 4*: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 5*: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **performance obligation** is a promise to deliver a distinct good or service. A **transaction price** is the amount a firm expects to receive from a customer in exchange for transferring a good or service.\n",
    "\n",
    "For long-term contracts, revenue is recognized based on a firm's progress toward completing a performance obligation. Progress toward completion can be measured from the input side (e.g., using the percentage of completion costs incurred), or from the output side (e.g., using the percentage of total output delivered to date).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expense Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the accrual method of accounting, expense recognition is based on the **matching principle**, whereby expenses for producing goods and services are recognized in the period in which the revenue for the goods and services is recognized. Expenses that are not tied directly to generating revenue, such as administrative costs, are called **period costs** and are expensed in the period incurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of long-lived assets must also be matched with revenues. As a general rule, an expenditure that is expected to provide a future economic benefit over multiple accounting periods is **capitalized**; however, if the future economic benefit is unlikely or highly uncertain, the expenditure is **expensed** in the period incurred. The allocation of cost over an asset's useful life is known as **depreciation** for tangible assets, **amortization** for intangible assets, or **depletion** for natural resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a firm constructs an asset for its own use (or, in limited circumstances, for resale), the interest that accrues during the construction period is capitalized as a part of the asset's cost. Capitalized interest is not reported in the income statement as interest expense. Once construction interest is capitalized, the interest cost is allocated to the income statement through depreciation expense (if the asset is held for use) or cost of goods sold (if the asset is held for sale). Capitalizing interest results in it being reported in the cash flow statement as an outflow from investing activities. This contrasts with the usual treatment of interest paid, which is reported as an outflow from operating activities under U.S. GAAP and can be an operating or financing outflow under IFRS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under IFRS, **research costs**, which are costs aimed at the discovery of new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, are expensed as incurred. However, **development costs** may be capitalized. Under U.S. GAAP, both research and development costs are generally expensed as incurred. However, the costs of creating software for sale to others are treated in a manner similar to the treatment of research and development costs under IFRS.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a firm sells goods or services on credit or provides a warranty to the customer, the matching principle requires the firm to estimate bad-debt expense and/or warranty expense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because estimates are involved in expense recognition, it is possible for firms to delay or accelerate the recognition of expense. Delayed expense recognition increases net income—and is, therefore, more aggressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nonrecurring Items\n",
    "\n",
    "A **discontinued operation** is one that management has decided to dispose of, but either has not yet done so, or has disposed of in the current period after the operation had generated income or losses. It must be physically and operationally distinct from the rest of the firm. Income and losses from discontinued operations are reported separately in the income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations. Discontinued operations do not affect net income from continuing operations, so analysts should exclude discontinued operations when forecasting future earnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unusual or infrequent items** are recorded for events that are either unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence. Unusual or infrequent items are included in income from continuing operations. Examples include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gains or losses from the sale of assets or part of a business (that do not qualify as discontinued operations)\n",
    "* Impairments, write-offs, write-downs, and restructuring costs\n",
    "\n",
    "An analyst must review these to determine their effect, if any, on future income.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accounting Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "Accounting changes include changes in accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates, and prior-period adjustments. Such changes may require either **retrospective application** or **prospective application**. With retrospective application, any prior-period financial statements presented in a firm's current financial statements must be restated, applying the new policy to those statements as well as future statements. Retrospective application enhances the comparability of the financial statements over time. With prospective application, prior statements are not restated, and the new policies are applied only to future financial statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard-setting bodies, at times, issue a **change in accounting policy**. Sometimes, a firm may change which accounting policy it applies, such as changing its inventory costing method or capitalizing rather than expensing specific purchases. Unless it is impractical, changes in accounting policies require retrospective application.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the recent change to revenue recognition standards, firms were given the option of **modified retrospective application**. This application does not require restatement of prior-period statements; however, beginning values of affected accounts are adjusted for the cumulative effects of the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, a **change in accounting estimate** is the result of a change in management's judgment, usually due to new information. For example, management may change the estimated useful life of an asset because new information indicates the asset has a longer life than originally expected. Changes in accounting estimates are applied prospectively and do not require the restatement of prior financial statements. Accounting estimate changes typically do not affect cash flow. An analyst should review changes in accounting estimates to determine their impact on future operating results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, a change from an incorrect accounting method to one that is acceptable under GAAP or IFRS is required. A correction of an accounting error is reported as a **prior-period adjustment** and requires retrospective application. Prior-period results are restated. Disclosure of the nature of any significant prior-period adjustment and of its effect on net income is also required. Prior-period adjustments usually involve errors or new accounting standards and typically do not affect cash flow. Analysts should review adjustments carefully because errors may indicate weaknesses in the firm's internal control system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Earnings Per Share\n",
    "\n",
    "The following basic definitions are essential:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Potentially dilutive securities.** These include stock options, warrants, convertible debt, and convertible preferred stock.\n",
    "* **Dilutive securities.** These are securities that would decrease EPS if exercised or converted to common stock.\n",
    "* **Antidilutive securities.** These are securities that would increase EPS if exercised or converted to common stock.\n",
    "* **Simple capital structure.** This is a capital structure that contains no potentially dilutive securities.\n",
    "* **Complex capital structure.** Complex structures contain potentially dilutive securities.\n",
    "* **Weighted average shares outstanding.** Each share issue is weighted by the portion of the year it was outstanding. Stock splits and stock dividends are applied retroactively to the beginning of the year, so \"old\" shares are converted to \"new\" shares for consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **basic EPS** calculation does not consider the effects of any dilutive securities in the computation of EPS. It is the only EPS presented for firms with simple capital structures and is one of the two EPS calculations presented for firms with complex capital structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{basic EPS} = \\large \\frac{\\text{net income – preferred dividends}}{\\text{weighted average number of common shares outstanding}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If a firm has a complex capital structure (contains potentially dilutive securities), both basic and **diluted EPS** must be reported. To calculate diluted EPS, treat any dilutive securities as if they were converted to common stock from the start of the accounting period (or when issued, if issued during the current year).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each potentially dilutive security must be considered separately to determine whether or not it is actually dilutive for the current reporting period.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether a convertible security is dilutive, calculate the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\large\\frac{\\text{convertible pfd. dividends}}{\\text{number shares from conversion of conv. pfd. shares}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\large\\frac{\\text{convertible debt interest (1–tax rate)}}{\\text{number shares from conversion of conv. debt}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If the calculated amount is less than basic EPS, the security is dilutive.\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering dilutive securities, the denominator is the basic EPS denominator adjusted for the equivalent number of common shares created by the conversion of all outstanding dilutive securities (convertible bonds, convertible preferred shares, plus options and warrants).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{diluted EPS} = \\large \\frac{\\text{adjusted income available for common shares}}{\\text{weighted-average common and potential common shares outstanding}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where adjusted income available for common shares is:\n",
    "\n",
    "earnings available for common shares\n",
    "\n",
    "+ dividends on dilutive convertible preferred stock\n",
    "\n",
    "+ after-tax interest on dilutive convertible debt\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><br></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, diluted EPS is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{diluted EPS} = \\frac{[\\text{net income - preferred dividends}] + (\\text{convertible preferred dividends})+ (\\text{convertible debt interest}) (1-t)}{(\\text{weighted average shares}) + (\\text{shares from conversion of conv. pfd. shares}) + (\\text{shares from conversion of conv. debt}) + ( \\text{shares issuable from stock options} ) }\n",
