    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial reporting refers to the way companies show their financial performance to investors, creditors, and other interested parties by preparing and presenting financial statements. The role of financial statement analysis is to use the information in a company's financial statements, along with other relevant information, to make economic decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **financial statement analysis framework$^1$** consists of six steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 1*: State the objective and context.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 2*: Gather data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 3*: Process the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 4*: Analyze and interpret the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 5*: Report the conclusions or recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 6*: Update the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Standard-setting bodies** are professional organizations of accountants and auditors that establish financial reporting standards. **Regulatory authorities** are government agencies that have the legal authority to enforce compliance with financial reporting standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two primary standard-setting bodies are the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). In the United States, the FASB sets forth the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP). Outside the United States, the IASB establishes the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Regulatory authorities, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the United Kingdom, are established by national governments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most national authorities belong to the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). IOSCO is not a regulatory body, but its members work together to improve cross-border cooperation and make national regulations and enforcement more uniform around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "SEC-required filings include <u>Form 8-K</u>, which a company must file to report events, such as acquisitions and disposals of major assets or changes in its management or corporate governance. Companies' annual and quarterly financial statements are also filed with the SEC (<u>Form 10-K</u> and <u>Form 10-Q</u>, respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Financial statement notes (footnotes)** include disclosures that provide further details about the information summarized in the financial statements. Footnotes allow users to improve their assessments of the amount, timing, and uncertainty of the estimates reported in the financial statements. Footnotes do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* They provide information about accounting methods, assumptions, and estimates used by management.\n",
    "* They are audited, whereas other disclosures, such as supplementary schedules, are not audited.\n",
    "* They provide additional information on such items as business acquisitions or disposals, legal actions, employee benefit plans, contingencies and commitments, significant customers, related-party transactions, position and performance of segments of the firm, and significant post-balance-sheet events.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A **business segment** or **operating segment** is a portion of a larger company that accounts for more than 10% of the company's revenues, assets, or income. Both U.S. GAAP and IFRS require companies to report segment data, but the required disclosure items are only a subset of the required disclosures for the company as a whole. **Geographic segments** are also identified when they both meet the size criterion and have a business environment that is different from that of other segments or the remainder of the company's business.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Management commentary**, or **management discussion and analysis (MD&A)**, provides an assessment of the financial performance and condition of a company from the perspective of its management. For publicly held companies in the United States, the MD&A is required to discuss the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Trends, significant events, and uncertainties that affect the firm\n",
    "* Effects of inflation and changing prices, if material\n",
    "* Impact of off-balance-sheet and contractual obligations\n",
    "* Accounting policies that require significant judgment by management\n",
    "* Forward-looking expenditures and divestitures\n",
    "\n",
    "### Audit Reports\n",
    "\n",
    "An **audit** is an independent review of an entity's financial statements. Public accountants conduct audits and examine the financial reports and supporting records. The objective of an audit is to enable the auditor to provide an opinion on the fairness and reliability of the financial reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "The independent certified public accounting firm employed by the board of directors is responsible for seeing that the financial statements conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The auditor examines the company's accounting and internal control systems, confirms assets and liabilities, and generally tries to be confident that there are no material errors in the financial statements and that they conform to applicable reporting standards. The auditor's report is an important source of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **standard auditor's opinion** contains three parts, stating the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Whereas the financial statements are prepared by management and are its responsibility, the auditor has performed an independent review.\n",
    "2. Generally accepted auditing standards were followed, thus providing reasonable assurance that the financial statements contain no material errors.\n",
    "3. The auditor is satisfied that the statements were prepared in accordance with accepted accounting principles and that the accounting principles chosen and estimates made are reasonable. The auditor's report must also contain additional explanation when accounting methods have not been used consistently between periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "An *unqualified opinion* (also known as an unmodified opinion or clean opinion) indicates that the auditor believes the statements are free from material omissions and errors. If the statements make any exceptions to the accounting principles, the auditor may issue a *qualified opinion* and explain these exceptions in the audit report. The auditor can issue an adverse opinion if the statements are not presented fairly or are materially nonconforming with accounting standards, or a *disclaimer of opinion* if the auditor is unable to express an opinion. Any opinion other than unqualified is sometimes referred to as a *modified opinion*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The auditor's opinion will also contain an explanatory paragraph when a material loss is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated. These uncertainties may relate to the *going concern assumption* (the firm will continue to operate for the foreseeable future), to the valuation or realization of assets, or to litigation. This type of disclosure may be a signal of serious problems and call for closer examination by the analyst. An audit report must also include a section called *key audit matters* (international reports) or *critical audit matters* (United States), which highlights accounting choices that are of greatest significance to users of financial statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under U.S. GAAP, the auditor must state an opinion on a publicly traded company's **internal controls**, the processes by which the company ensures that it presents accurate financial statements. Internal controls are the responsibility of the firm's management. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management is required to provide a report on the company's internal control system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Information Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proxy statements** are issued to shareholders when there are matters that require a shareholder vote. These statements, which are also filed with the SEC and available from EDGAR, are a good source of information about the election of (and qualifications of) board members, compensation, management qualifications, and the issuance of stock options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Corporate reports and press releases are written by management and are often viewed as public relations or sales materials. Not all of the material is independently reviewed by outside auditors. Such information can often be found on the company's website. Management may also provide **earnings guidance** to analysts before releasing the firm's financial statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "An analyst should review information on economic conditions and the company's industry and compare the company to its competitors. This information can be acquired from sources such as trade journals, statistical reporting services, and government agencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences Between IFRS and U.S. GAAP\n",
    "\n",
    "While the IASB and FASB work together to harmonize changes to accounting standards, some significant differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP still exist. The following table lists some of the most significant differences.\n",

    "As financial reporting standards continue to evolve, analysts need to monitor how these developments will affect the financial statements they use. An analyst should be aware of new products and innovations in the financial markets that generate new types of transactions. These might not fall neatly into the existing financial reporting standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep up to date on the evolving standards, an analyst can monitor professional journals and other sources, such as the IASB and FASB websites. CFA Institute produces position papers on financial reporting issues through the CFA Centre for Financial Market Integrity.\n",

    "### Revenue Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sale where the goods are exchanged for cash and returns are not allowed, the recognition of revenue is straightforward: it is recognized at the time of the exchange. The recognition of revenue is not, however, dependent on receiving cash payment. If a sale of goods is made on credit, revenue can be recognized at the time of sale—and an asset, **accounts receivable**, is created on the balance sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "If payment for the goods is received before the transfer of the good, a liability, **unearned revenue**, is created when the cash is received (offsetting the increase in the asset *cash*). Revenue is recognized as the goods are transferred to the buyer. As an example, consider a magazine subscription. When the subscription is purchased, an unearned revenue liability is created—and as magazine issues are delivered, revenue is recorded and the liability is decreased.\n",
    "\n",
    "Converged standards under IFRS and U.S. GAAP take a principles-based approach to revenue recognition issues. The central principle is that a firm should recognize revenue when it has transferred a good or service to a customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The converged standards identify a five-step process$^1$ for recognizing revenue:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 1*: Identify the contract(s) with a customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 2*: Identify the separate or distinct performance obligations in the contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 3*: Determine the transaction price.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 4*: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 5*: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **performance obligation** is a promise to deliver a distinct good or service. A **transaction price** is the amount a firm expects to receive from a customer in exchange for transferring a good or service.\n",
    "\n",
    "For long-term contracts, revenue is recognized based on a firm's progress toward completing a performance obligation. Progress toward completion can be measured from the input side (e.g., using the percentage of completion costs incurred), or from the output side (e.g., using the percentage of total output delivered to date).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expense Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the accrual method of accounting, expense recognition is based on the **matching principle**, whereby expenses for producing goods and services are recognized in the period in which the revenue for the goods and services is recognized. Expenses that are not tied directly to generating revenue, such as administrative costs, are called **period costs** and are expensed in the period incurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of long-lived assets must also be matched with revenues. As a general rule, an expenditure that is expected to provide a future economic benefit over multiple accounting periods is **capitalized**; however, if the future economic benefit is unlikely or highly uncertain, the expenditure is **expensed** in the period incurred. The allocation of cost over an asset's useful life is known as **depreciation** for tangible assets, **amortization** for intangible assets, or **depletion** for natural resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a firm constructs an asset for its own use (or, in limited circumstances, for resale), the interest that accrues during the construction period is capitalized as a part of the asset's cost. Capitalized interest is not reported in the income statement as interest expense. Once construction interest is capitalized, the interest cost is allocated to the income statement through depreciation expense (if the asset is held for use) or cost of goods sold (if the asset is held for sale). Capitalizing interest results in it being reported in the cash flow statement as an outflow from investing activities. This contrasts with the usual treatment of interest paid, which is reported as an outflow from operating activities under U.S. GAAP and can be an operating or financing outflow under IFRS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under IFRS, **research costs**, which are costs aimed at the discovery of new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, are expensed as incurred. However, **development costs** may be capitalized. Under U.S. GAAP, both research and development costs are generally expensed as incurred. However, the costs of creating software for sale to others are treated in a manner similar to the treatment of research and development costs under IFRS.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a firm sells goods or services on credit or provides a warranty to the customer, the matching principle requires the firm to estimate bad-debt expense and/or warranty expense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because estimates are involved in expense recognition, it is possible for firms to delay or accelerate the recognition of expense. Delayed expense recognition increases net income—and is, therefore, more aggressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nonrecurring Items\n",
    "\n",
    "A **discontinued operation** is one that management has decided to dispose of, but either has not yet done so, or has disposed of in the current period after the operation had generated income or losses. It must be physically and operationally distinct from the rest of the firm. Income and losses from discontinued operations are reported separately in the income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations. Discontinued operations do not affect net income from continuing operations, so analysts should exclude discontinued operations when forecasting future earnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unusual or infrequent items** are recorded for events that are either unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence. Unusual or infrequent items are included in income from continuing operations. Examples include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gains or losses from the sale of assets or part of a business (that do not qualify as discontinued operations)\n",
    "* Impairments, write-offs, write-downs, and restructuring costs\n",
    "\n",
    "An analyst must review these to determine their effect, if any, on future income.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accounting Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "Accounting changes include changes in accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates, and prior-period adjustments. Such changes may require either **retrospective application** or **prospective application**. With retrospective application, any prior-period financial statements presented in a firm's current financial statements must be restated, applying the new policy to those statements as well as future statements. Retrospective application enhances the comparability of the financial statements over time. With prospective application, prior statements are not restated, and the new policies are applied only to future financial statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard-setting bodies, at times, issue a **change in accounting policy**. Sometimes, a firm may change which accounting policy it applies, such as changing its inventory costing method or capitalizing rather than expensing specific purchases. Unless it is impractical, changes in accounting policies require retrospective application.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the recent change to revenue recognition standards, firms were given the option of **modified retrospective application**. This application does not require restatement of prior-period statements; however, beginning values of affected accounts are adjusted for the cumulative effects of the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, a **change in accounting estimate** is the result of a change in management's judgment, usually due to new information. For example, management may change the estimated useful life of an asset because new information indicates the asset has a longer life than originally expected. Changes in accounting estimates are applied prospectively and do not require the restatement of prior financial statements. Accounting estimate changes typically do not affect cash flow. An analyst should review changes in accounting estimates to determine their impact on future operating results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, a change from an incorrect accounting method to one that is acceptable under GAAP or IFRS is required. A correction of an accounting error is reported as a **prior-period adjustment** and requires retrospective application. Prior-period results are restated. Disclosure of the nature of any significant prior-period adjustment and of its effect on net income is also required. Prior-period adjustments usually involve errors or new accounting standards and typically do not affect cash flow. Analysts should review adjustments carefully because errors may indicate weaknesses in the firm's internal control system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Earnings Per Share\n",
    "\n",
    "The following basic definitions are essential:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Potentially dilutive securities.** These include stock options, warrants, convertible debt, and convertible preferred stock.\n",
    "* **Dilutive securities.** These are securities that would decrease EPS if exercised or converted to common stock.\n",
    "* **Antidilutive securities.** These are securities that would increase EPS if exercised or converted to common stock.\n",
    "* **Simple capital structure.** This is a capital structure that contains no potentially dilutive securities.\n",
    "* **Complex capital structure.** Complex structures contain potentially dilutive securities.\n",
    "* **Weighted average shares outstanding.** Each share issue is weighted by the portion of the year it was outstanding. Stock splits and stock dividends are applied retroactively to the beginning of the year, so \"old\" shares are converted to \"new\" shares for consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **basic EPS** calculation does not consider the effects of any dilutive securities in the computation of EPS. It is the only EPS presented for firms with simple capital structures and is one of the two EPS calculations presented for firms with complex capital structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{basic EPS} = \\large \\frac{\\text{net income – preferred dividends}}{\\text{weighted average number of common shares outstanding}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If a firm has a complex capital structure (contains potentially dilutive securities), both basic and **diluted EPS** must be reported. To calculate diluted EPS, treat any dilutive securities as if they were converted to common stock from the start of the accounting period (or when issued, if issued during the current year).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each potentially dilutive security must be considered separately to determine whether or not it is actually dilutive for the current reporting period.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether a convertible security is dilutive, calculate the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\large\\frac{\\text{convertible pfd. dividends}}{\\text{number shares from conversion of conv. pfd. shares}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\large\\frac{\\text{convertible debt interest (1–tax rate)}}{\\text{number shares from conversion of conv. debt}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If the calculated amount is less than basic EPS, the security is dilutive.\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering dilutive securities, the denominator is the basic EPS denominator adjusted for the equivalent number of common shares created by the conversion of all outstanding dilutive securities (convertible bonds, convertible preferred shares, plus options and warrants).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{diluted EPS} = \\large \\frac{\\text{adjusted income available for common shares}}{\\text{weighted-average common and potential common shares outstanding}}\n",

    "where adjusted income available for common shares is:\n",
    "\n",
    "earnings available for common shares\n",

    "+ dividends on dilutive convertible preferred stock\n",
    "\n",
    "+ after-tax interest on dilutive convertible debt\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><br></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, diluted EPS is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{diluted EPS} = \\frac{[\\text{net income - preferred dividends}] + (\\text{convertible preferred dividends})+ (\\text{convertible debt interest}) (1-t)}{(\\text{weighted average shares}) + (\\text{shares from conversion of conv. pfd. shares}) + (\\text{shares from conversion of conv. debt}) + ( \\text{shares issuable from stock options} ) }\n",

    "With respect to convertible bonds, remember that what you are looking for is a reduction in EPS. The denominator is rising due to the increased number of shares, and the numerator is rising due to the after-tax interest cost savings. When the denominator is rising faster than the numerator, conversion is dilutive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **treasury stock method** assumes that the funds received by the company from the exercise of options or warrants would be used hypothetically to purchase shares of the company's common stock in the market, at the average market price over the reporting period.\n",

    "**Goodwill** is an unidentifiable intangible asset created when a business is purchased for more than the fair value of its assets, net of liabilities. Goodwill is not amortized, but it must be tested for impairment (a decrease in its fair value) at least annually. Because goodwill is not amortized, firms can manipulate net income upward by allocating more of the acquisition price to goodwill and less to the identifiable assets. The result is less depreciation and amortization expense—and thus, higher net income.\n",

    "* Securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI)\n",
    "* Securities measured at fair value through profit and loss\n",

    "* Trading securities\n",
    "\n",

    "Under IFRS, firms may make an irrevocable choice at the time of purchase to account for equity securities as measured at fair value through OCI. Also, IFRS firms can make an irrevocable choice to carry any financial asset at fair value through profit and loss. These choices are not available under U.S. GAAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Noncurrent Liabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "**Long-term financial liabilities** include bank loans, notes payable, bonds payable, and some derivatives. If the financial liabilities are not issued at face value, they are usually reported on the balance sheet at amortized cost. Any premium or discount is amortized through interest expense over the life of the liability. Amortizing premiums and discounts cause the balance sheet liability to move toward face value at maturity of the liability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial liabilities reported at fair value include held-for-trading liabilities such as a short position in a stock (which may be classified as a short-term liability), derivative liabilities, and nonderivative liabilities with exposures hedged by derivatives.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Operating Cash Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "The analyst should identify the major determinants of operating cash flow—primarily, the firm's earning-related activities and changes in noncash working capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equality of operating cash flow and net income is an indication of high-quality earnings, but it can be affected by the stage of business cycle and of the firm's life cycle. Earnings that exceed operating cash flow may be an indication of premature recognition of revenues or delayed recognition of expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Investing Cash Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing capital expenditures, a use of cash, is usually an indication of growth. Conversely, a firm may reduce capital expenditures or even sell capital assets to conserve or generate cash. This may result in higher cash outflows in the future as older assets are replaced or growth resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Financing Cash Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "The financing activities section of the cash flow statement reveals information about whether the firm is generating cash by issuing debt or equity. It also indicates whether the firm is using cash to repay debt, reacquire stock, or pay dividends.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cash flow statement can be converted to **common-size format** by expressing each line item as a percentage of revenue. Alternatively, each inflow of cash can be expressed as a percentage of total cash inflows, and each outflow of cash can be expressed as a percentage of total cash outflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Free cash flow** is a measure of cash that is available for discretionary use, after a firm has covered its capital expenditures. **Free cash flow to the firm (FCFF)** is the cash available to all investors, both equity owners and debtholders. FCFF can be calculated using net income or operating cash flow as a starting point.\n",

    "### Inventory Values on the Balance Sheet\n",
    "\n",
    "Under IFRS, inventory is reported on the balance sheet at the lower of cost or **net realizable value**, which is expected sales price less selling costs and completion costs. If NRV is less than the balance sheet value of inventory, the inventory is \"written down\" to NRV, and the loss is recognized in the income statement either as a separate line item or by increasing COGS. Inventory \"write-up\" is allowed, but only to the extent that a previous write-down to net realizable value was recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under U.S. GAAP, companies that use LIFO or the retail method value inventories at the lower of cost or market. Market is usually equal to replacement cost, but it cannot exceed net realizable value or be less than net realizable value minus a normal profit margin. For companies using cost methods other than LIFO or retail, inventory valuation is similar to IFRS. No subsequent write-up of inventory values that have been written down is allowed under U.S. GAAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "In certain industries—primarily, producers and dealers of commodities—reporting inventory above historical cost is permitted under IFRS and U.S. GAAP. If an active market exists for the commodity, the quoted market price is used to value the inventory. Otherwise, recent market transactions are used.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Ratios and Inventory Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding *profitability*, as compared to FIFO, LIFO produces higher COGS in the income statement and will result in lower earnings. Any profitability measure that includes COGS will be lower under LIFO. For example, higher COGS will result in lower gross, operating, and net profit margins as compared to FIFO.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding *liquidity*, compared to FIFO, LIFO results in a lower inventory value on the balance sheet. Because inventory (a current asset) is lower under LIFO, the current ratio, a popular measure of liquidity, is also lower under LIFO than under FIFO. Working capital is lower under LIFO as well because current assets are lower. The quick ratio is unaffected by the firm's inventory cost flow method because inventory is excluded from its numerator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding *activity*, inventory turnover (COGS / average inventory) is higher for firms that use LIFO compared to firms that use FIFO. Under LIFO, COGS is valued at more recent, higher costs (higher numerator), while inventory is valued at older, lower costs (lower denominator). Higher turnover under LIFO will result in lower days of inventory on hand (365 / inventory turnover).\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding *solvency*, LIFO results in lower total assets compared to FIFO because LIFO inventory is lower. Lower total assets under LIFO result in lower stockholders' equity (assets − liabilities). Because total assets and stockholders' equity are lower under LIFO, the debt ratio and the debt-to-equity ratio are higher under LIFO compared to FIFO.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LIFO Liquidation\n",
    "\n",
    "A **LIFO liquidation** occurs when a LIFO firm's inventory quantities decline. In a rising price environment, COGS are based on older, lower unit costs, which makes COGS artificially low. The reduction in COGS from a LIFO liquidation increases gross and net profits and margins, but these increases are not sustainable. A decrease in the LIFO reserve (disclosed in footnotes for LIFO companies) can alert analysts that a LIFO liquidation may be responsible for an increase in current-period profits and profit margins.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Purchased intangible assets** that do not have physical substance but have finite lives (e.g., patents and franchises) are reported on the balance sheet at their fair values, which are reduced over their economic lives by amortization (like depreciation of a physical asset).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most **internally developed intangible assets** are not reported on the balance sheet. Values of intangible assets that do not have finite lives (e.g., goodwill) and of those that can be renewed at minimal cost (e.g., trademarks) are not amortized, but they must be checked periodically for impairment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exception is **research and development**. Firms reporting under IFRS must expense research costs as incurred but may capitalize development costs (costs incurred after technological feasibility and the intent to use or sell the completed asset have been established).\n",
    "\n",
    "Under U.S. GAAP, costs to develop software are capitalized in some circumstances:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Software for sale to others.* Costs are expensed as incurred until the product's technological feasibility has been established, after which the costs of developing a salable product are capitalized.\n",
    "* *Software for internal use.* Costs must be expensed until it is probable that the firm will complete the project and use the software as intended.\n",

    "**Goodwill** results from business combinations. Under the **acquisition method**, the price paid to acquire a firm is allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired firm on the basis of fair value. Any remaining amount of the purchase price is recorded as goodwill. Only goodwill created in a business combination is capitalized on the balance sheet. The costs of any internally generated \"goodwill\" are expensed in the period incurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Impairments\n",
    "\n",
    "Under IFRS, the firm must annually assess whether events or circumstances indicate that an **impairment** of an asset's value has occurred. For example, there may have been a significant decline in the market value of the asset or a significant change in the asset's physical condition. If so, the asset's value must be tested for impairment.\n",
    "\n",
    "An asset is impaired when its carrying value (original cost less accumulated depreciation) exceeds the recoverable amount. The **recoverable amount** is the greater of its fair value less any selling costs and its **value in use**. The value in use is the present value of its future cash flow stream from continued use and disposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "If impaired, the asset's value must be written down on the balance sheet to the recoverable amount. An impairment loss, equal to the excess of carrying value over the recoverable amount, is recognized in the income statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under IFRS, the loss can be reversed if the value of the impaired asset recovers in the future. However, the loss reversal is limited to the original impairment loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under U.S. GAAP, an asset is tested for impairment only when events and circumstances indicate the firm may not be able to recover the carrying value through future use.\n",

    "Determining an impairment and calculating the loss potentially involves two steps. In the first step, the asset is tested for impairment by applying a **recoverability test**. If the asset is impaired, the second step involves measuring the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding **recoverability**, an asset is considered impaired if the carrying value (original cost less accumulated depreciation) is greater than the asset's future *undiscounted* cash flow stream. Because the recoverability test is based on estimates of future undiscounted cash flows, tests for impairment involve considerable management discretion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding **loss measurement**, if impaired, the asset's value is written down to fair value on the balance sheet — and a loss, equal to the excess of carrying value over the fair value of the asset (or the discounted value of its future cash flows if the fair value is not known), is recognized in the income statement.\n",

    "### Derecognition of Long-Lived Assets\n",
    "\n",
    "Long-lived assets are *derecognized* and removed from the balance sheet when they are sold, exchanged, or abandoned.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a long-lived asset is sold, the asset is removed from the balance sheet, and the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the asset is reported as a gain or loss in the income statement. The carrying value is equal to original cost minus accumulated depreciation and any impairment charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gain or loss is usually reported in the income statement as a part of other gains and losses, or reported separately as an unusual or infrequent item if material. Also, if the firm presents its cash flow statement using the indirect method, the gain or loss is removed from net income to compute cash flow from operations because the proceeds from selling a long-lived asset are an investing cash inflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a long-lived asset is abandoned, the treatment is similar to a sale, except there are no proceeds. In this case, the carrying value of the asset is removed from the balance sheet, and a loss of that amount is recognized in the income statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a long-lived asset is exchanged for another asset, a gain or loss is computed by comparing the carrying value of the old asset with fair value of the old asset (or the fair value of the new asset, if that value is clearly more evident). The carrying value of the old asset is removed from the balance sheet, and the new asset is recorded at its fair value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis of Long-Lived Asset Disclosures\n",
    "\n",
    "An analyst can use financial statement disclosures to estimate the **average age** and **useful life** of a firm's long-lived assets. Older, less efficient assets may make a firm less competitive. The average age of assets is useful in estimating the timing of major capital expenditures and a firm's future financing requirements. These estimates are most accurate for a firm that uses straight-line depreciation.\n",

    "### Leases\n",
    "\n",
    "With a lease, a firm (the **lessee**) essentially purchases the right to use an asset from another firm (the lessor) for a specified period. Advantages of leasing rather than purchasing an asset may include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Less initial cash outflow*. Typically, a lease requires only a small down payment, if any.\n",
    "* *Less costly financing*. The interest rate implicit in a lease contract may be less than the interest rate on a loan to purchase the asset.\n",
    "* *Less risk of obsolescence*. At the end of a lease, the lessee often returns the leased asset to the lessor—and, therefore, does not bear the risk of an unexpected decline in the asset's end-of-lease value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be a lease, a contract must meet the following three requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It must refer to a specific asset.\n",
    "2. It must give the lessee effectively all the asset's economic benefits during the term of the lease.\n",
    "3. It must give the lessee the right to determine how to use the asset during the term of the lease.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lessee Financial Reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "Under IFRS and U.S. GAAP, a finance lease is any lease in which both the benefits and risks of ownership are substantially transferred to the lessee. If either the benefits or the risks are not substantially transferred to the lessee, a lease is classified as an operating lease. Any given lease will be classified the same way by the lessee and the lessor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under IFRS, for both finance and operating leases (except those that are short term or of low value), the lessee records a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet, both equal to the present value of the lease payments. The ROU asset is amortized straight-line over the term of the lease. The amortization amount and the interest portion of each lease payment are reported (separately) as expenses on the income statement. The lease liability is reduced each period by the principal portion of the lease payment. So, while the asset and liability both begin with the same value and reach zero at the end of the lease, their values can differ during the life of the lease, as the amortization of the ROU asset will exceed the principal portion of the lease payment in the early years of a lease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under U.S. GAAP, a lessee accounts for finance leases just as under IFRS. With an operating lease, the lessee reports both the interest portion of the lease payment and the amortization of the ROU asset (which is equal to the interest portion of the lease payment, not straight-line as under IFRS) on the income statement as a single expense. Because the amortization of the lease liability and the amortization of the ROU asset are equal each period, the asset and liability will have equal values over the life of the lease.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all leases under IFRS, the principal portion of the lease payment is a financing cash outflow, while the interest portion may be reported as an operating or financing cash outflow. Under U.S. GAAP, for a finance lease, the interest portion of the lease payment is an operating cash outflow and the principal portion is a financing cash outflow. For an operating lease under U.S. GAAP, the full lease payment is classified as an operating cash outflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lessor Financial Reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "For lessors, the financial reporting of both finance and operating leases is the same under IFRS and U.S. GAAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding a *finance lease*, at initiation, the lessor removes the leased asset from its balance sheet and adds a **lease receivable** asset, equal to the present value of the expected lease payments. If this value is different from the asset's book value, the lessor recognizes a profit or a loss. Over the term of the lease, the lessor uses the effective interest method (the same as lessees) to amortize the lease receivable and reports the interest portion of the lease payments as income. If leasing is one of the lessor's primary business activities, this interest income is included in revenues for the period. The entire cash inflow (interest and principal) is classified as cash from operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding an *operating lease*, the lessor keeps the leased asset on its balance sheet and continues to record depreciation expense. On the income statement, the lessor reports the lease payments as income and reports depreciation and other costs associated with leasing the asset as expenses. As with a finance lease, the entire cash inflow is cash from operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deferred Compensation\n",
    "\n",
    "A **defined contribution pension plan** is a retirement plan in which the firm contributes a sum each period to the employee's retirement account. The firm makes no promise to the employee regarding the future value of the plan assets. The investment decisions are left to the employee, who assumes all of the investment risk. On the income statement, pension expense is simply equal to the employer's contribution. There is no future liability to report on the balance sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **defined benefit pension plan**, the firm promises to make periodic payments to employees after retirement. The benefit is usually based on the employee's years of service and the employee's compensation at, or near, retirement. For example, an employee might earn a retirement benefit of 2% of her final salary for each year of service. Because the employee's future benefit is defined, the employer assumes the investment risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial reporting for a defined benefit plan is much more complicated than for a defined contribution plan because the employer must estimate the value of the future obligation to its employees. The obligation involves forecasting numerous variables, such as future compensation levels, employee turnover, average retirement age, mortality rates, and an appropriate discount rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For defined benefit plans, if the fair value of the plan's assets is greater than the estimated pension obligation, the plan is said to be **overfunded**, and the sponsoring firm records a **net pension asset** on its balance sheet. If the fair value of the plan's assets is less than the estimated pension obligation, the plan is **underfunded**, and the firm records a **net pension liability** on its balance sheet. A net pension asset or liability is referred to as a plan's **funded status**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The change in the net pension asset or liability is reported each year. Some components of the change are included in net income, while others are included in OCI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under IFRS, the change in funded status has three elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There is service cost, which includes the present value of additional benefits employees have earned by working an additional year, as well as \"past service costs,\" which are changes to benefits earned in previous periods.\n",
    "2. There is net interest expense or income, which is interest income on a net pension asset or interest expense on a net pension liability. The amount equals the funded status times the plan's discount rate.\n",
    "3. There are remeasurements, which include actuarial gains and losses and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under U.S. GAAP, the change in funded status has five components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Service costs for the current period\n",
    "2. Interest expense or income\n",
    "3. The expected return on plan assets\n",
    "4. Past service costs\n",
    "5. Actuarial gains and losses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Share-based compensation** refers to issuing employees company stock or options to buy company stock. While doing so does not require cash outflows from the company, it dilutes the ownership of existing shareholders and reduces earnings per share. IFRS and U.S. GAAP both require the company to estimate the fair value of any stock-based compensation at the **grant date**, and to expense it to the income statement over the **vesting period** or **service period** — the time between the grant date and when the employee receives the stock or can first exercise a stock option.\n",
