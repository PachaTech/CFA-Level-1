# SECRET SAUCE

# Foreword

This book will be a valuable addition to the study tools of any CFA exam candidate. It offers a concise and readable explanation of the major parts of the Level I CFA curriculum. Here is the disclaimer: this book does not cover every Learning Outcome Statement (LOS) and, as you are aware, any LOS is "fair game" for the exam. We have tried to include those LOS that are key concepts in finance and accounting, have application to other LOS, are complex and difficult for candidates, require memorization of characteristics or relationships, or are a prelude to LOS at Levels II and III.

We suggest you use this book as a companion to your other, more comprehensive study materials. It is easier to carry with you and will allow you to study these key concepts, definitions, and techniques over and over, which is an important part of mastering the material. When you get to topics where the coverage here appears too brief or raises questions in your mind, this is your clue to go back to your SchweserNotesâ„¢ or the textbooks to fill in the gaps in your understanding. For the great majority of you, there is no shortcut to learning the very broad array of subjects covered by the Level I curriculum, but this volume should be a valuable tool for reviewing and retaining the material as you complete your preparations in the weeks leading up to your exam day.

Pass rates for most Level I exams in recent years have been 40% or less, and returning candidates make comments such as, "I was surprised at how difficult the exam was." You should not despair because of this, but you should definitely not underestimate the task at hand. Our study materials, mock exams, question bank, videos, seminars, and Secret Sauce are all designed to help you study as efficiently as possible, help you to grasp and retain the material, and apply it with confidence come exam day.
