    "\n",
    "The four types of capital investments include going concern projects, regulatory/compliance projects, expansion projects, and other projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Going concern projects** may be needed to maintain the business or reduce costs. Projects that maintain the business do not require detailed analysis. The only issues are whether the existing operations should continue and, if so, whether existing procedures or processes should be maintained. Projects to improve efficiency may involve determining if equipment that is obsolete, but still usable, should be replaced. To reduce financing risk, companies often use a **match funding** approach, financing projects with capital sources that are consistent with the project life. Analysts often use a company's annual depreciation expense as an estimate of the capital investment it needs for going concern projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Regulatory/compliance projects** may be required by a government agency or insurance company and often involve safety-related or environmental concerns. These projects typically generate little to no revenue and require the company to evaluate alternative ways of carrying out the projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Expansion projects** grow the business and require a complex decision-making process that includes forecasting future demand. Expansion projects can involve entering new markets or introducing new products within the same market. A detailed analysis including forecasting revenues and expenses is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Other projects, such as new investments outside a company's existing lines of business, also entail a complex decision-making process with detailed analysis due to the uncertainty involved. Other projects are often similar to startups that explore a new technology or business idea. These projects can also involve buying out an existing company in a new industry, which involve risks that include overpaying.\n",

    "\n",
    "The **capital allocation process** is identifying and evaluating capital projects (i.e., projects where the cash flows to the firm will be received over a period longer than a year). Any corporate decisions with an impact on future earnings can be examined using this framework. Decisions about buying a new machine, expanding business into another geographic area, moving the corporate headquarters to Cleveland, or replacing a delivery truck, to name a few, can be examined using a capital allocation analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a number of good reasons, capital allocation may be the most important responsibility that a financial manager has. First, because a capital allocation decision often involves the purchase of costly long-term assets with lives of many years, the decisions made may determine the future success of the firm. Second, the principles underlying the capital allocation process also apply to other corporate decisions, such as working capital management and making strategic mergers and acquisitions. Finally, making good capital allocation decisions is consistent with management's primary goal of maximizing shareholder value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The capital allocation process has four administrative steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1: *Idea generation*. The most important step in the capital allocation process is generating good project ideas. Ideas can come from a number of sources, including senior management, functional divisions, employees, or sources outside the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 2: *Analyzing project proposals.* Because the decision to accept or reject a capital project is based on the project's expected future cash flows, a cash flow forecast must be made for each project to determine its expected profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 3: *Create the firm-wide capital budget*. Firms must prioritize profitable projects according to the timing of the project's cash flows, available company resources, and the company's overall strategic plan. Many projects that are attractive individually may not make sense strategically.  *Capital Rationing*\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 4: *Monitoring decisions and conducting a post-audit*. It is important to follow up on all capital allocation decisions. An analyst should compare the actual results to the projected results, and project managers should explain why projections did or did not match actual performance. Because the capital allocation process is only as good as the estimates of the inputs into the model used to forecast cash flows, a post-audit should be used to identify systematic errors in the forecasting process and improve company operations.  *EX-ANTE*\n",

    "\n",
    "The capital allocation process involves the following key principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Decisions are based on after-tax cash flows, not accounting income.* Accounting income is based on accruals and does not consider the timing of cash flows. The impact of taxes must be considered when analyzing all capital allocation projects. Firm value is based on cash flows firms get to keep, not those they send to the government. Any tax savings from non-cash tax deductions, such as depreciation and amortization, should also be included in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Incremental cash flows only.* Incremental cash flows are those that change if the project is undertaken. **Sunk costs** are costs that cannot be avoided even if the project is not undertaken. Because these costs are not affected by the accept/ reject decision, they should not be included in the analysis. An example of a sunk cost is a consulting fee paid to a marketing research firm to estimate demand for a new product before making a decision on the project. Project analysis should consider the cash flow impact on other parts of the business. A negative effect, called cannibalization, occurs when a new project replaces sales from an existing product. An example of cannibalization is when a soft drink company introduces a diet version of an existing beverage. A positive externality exists when doing the project would have a positive effect on sales of a firm's other product lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *The timing of cash flows* is important. Capital allocation decisions account for the time value of money, which means that cash flows received earlier are worth more than cash flows to be received later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common mistakes managers make when evaluating capital projects have two categories: cognitive errors (calculation errors) and behavioral biases (errors of judgment)."

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "#### Behavioral Biases\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Pet projects of senior management.* Projects that have the personal backing of influential members of senior management may contain overly optimistic projections that make the project appear more profitable than it really is. In addition, the project might not be subjected to the same level of scrutiny as other projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Inertia in setting the entire capital budget.* Capital budgets for many companies are similar from one year to the next. This indicates anchoring of capital budgets to the prior year rather than appropriately considering what opportunities exist every year. In a company with a culture of maximizing shareholder value, managers will return excess funds to shareholders whenever there is a lack of positive NPV projects and make a case for expanding the budget when there are multiple positive NPV opportunities. Analysts should watch for companies with static or rising capital budgets coupled with declining returns as a sign of this bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Basing investment decisions on EPS or ROE.* Managers whose incentive compensation is tied to increasing EPS or ROE may avoid positive long-term NPV investments that are expected to reduce EPS or ROE in the short run.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Failure to generate alternative investment ideas.* Generating investment ideas is a crucial step in the capital allocation process. However, once a manager comes up with a \"good\" idea, he or she may go with it rather than searching for an idea that is \"better.\"\n"

    "\n",
    "**Real options** are future actions that a firm can take, given that they invest in a project today. Real options are similar to financial options (put and call options) in that they give the option holder the right, but not the obligation, to take a future action. The value of real options could enhance a project's NPV. Options never have negative values because if, in the future, the specified action will have a negative value, the option holder will not take the action (i.e., not exercise the option).\n",

    "* **Timing options** allow a company to delay making an investment because it expects to have better information in the future.\n",
    "* **Abandonment options** allow management to abandon a project if the present value of the incremental cash flows from exiting a project exceeds the present value of the incremental cash flows from continuing the project.\n",
    "* **Expansion options** or growth options allow a company to make additional investments in future projects if the company decides they will create value.\n",
    "* **Flexibility options** give managers choices regarding the operational aspects of a project. The two main forms are price-setting and production-flexibility options.\n",
    "    * **Price-setting options** allow the company to change the price of a product. For example, the company may raise prices if demand for a product is high in order to benefit from that demand without increasing production.\n",
    "    * **Production-flexibility options** may include paying workers overtime, using different materials as inputs, or producing a different variety of product.\n",
    "* **Fundamental options** are projects that are options themselves because the payoffs depend on the price of an underlying asset. For example, the payoff for a copper mine is dependent on the market price for copper. If copper prices are low, it may not make sense to open a copper mine, but if copper prices are high, opening the copper mine could be very profitable. The operator has the option to close the mine when prices are low and open it when prices are high.\n",

    "One way companies can include real options in their project analysis is to estimate their value and add it to the NPV (while subtracting any extra cost to acquire the real option). This can incorporate available techniques such as option pricing models or decision trees. Another approach is to simply consider the NPV without real options to be the project's minimum value."

    "\n",
    "Capital allocation is the process of evaluating capital projects (i.e., projects with cash flows over a period longer than one year).\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps of the capital allocation process are: \n",
    "1. generate investment ideas; \n",
    "2. analyze project ideas; \n",
    "3. create a firm-wide capital budget\n",
    "4. monitor decisions and conduct a post-audit.\n",
    "\n",
    "NPV is the sum of the present values of a project's expected cash flows and represents the change in firm value from undertaking a project. Positive NPV projects should be undertaken, but negative NPV projects should not because they are expected to decrease the value of the firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "An IRR is the discount rate at which the present values of a project's expected cash inflows and cash outflows are equal (i.e., the discount rate for which the NPV of a project is zero). A project for which the IRR is greater (less) than the appropriate discount rate for the project will have an NPV that is positive (negative) and should be accepted (not accepted).\n",
    "\n",
    "Return on invested capital can be compared to a company's required rate of return to indicate whether the company has increased or decreased firm value over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LOS 26.c\n",
    "\n",
    "Capital allocation decisions should be based on after-tax cash flows, ignore sunk costs, and capture any spillover effects on other parts of the business. Timing of cash flows is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common mistakes in the capital allocation process include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Having overly optimistic assumptions for pet projects of senior management\n",
    "* Basing long-term investment decisions on short-term EPS or ROE considerations\n",
    "* Poor cash flow estimation, misestimating overhead costs, and improper accounting for inflation\n",
    "* Not accounting for cost of internally generated funds in the estimate of required rate of return\n",
    "* Static capital budgets without regard to actual investment opportunities\n",
    "* Failure to generate alternative investment ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### LOS 26.d\n",
    "\n",
    "Real options allow managers to make future decisions that change the value of capital allocation decisions made today.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Timing options allow a company to delay making an investment.\n",
    "* Abandonment options allow management to abandon a project if the present value of the incremental cash flows from exiting a project exceeds the present value of the incremental cash flows from continuing a project.\n",
    "* Expansion options allow a company to make additional investments in a project if doing so creates value.\n",
    "* Flexibility options give managers choices regarding the operational aspects of a project. The two main forms are price-setting and production-flexibility options.\n",
    "* Fundamental options are projects that are options themselves because the payoffs depend on the price of an underlying asset."
