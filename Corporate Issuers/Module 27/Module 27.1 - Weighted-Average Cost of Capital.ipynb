    "### LOS 27.a: Calculate and interpret the weighted-average cost of capital for a company.\n",
    "\n",
    "An issuer's weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) is a blended rate that includes its cost of debt and equity:\n",
    "\n",
    "    WACC = [weight of debt × pretax cost of debt × (1 – tax rate)] + (weight of equity × cost of equity)\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of debt is lower than the cost of equity because debt has priority of claims over equity. Because most jurisdictions allow tax deductions for corporate interest expense, we adjust the pretax cost of debt to its after-tax value in the WACC formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights for debt and equity can be target weights or market value weights. Analysts often estimate a company's target weights based on book value of debt and equity. Market value weights are appropriate for estimating the current opportunity cost of capital as they reflect current market conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: WACC\n",
    "\n",
    "ABC, Inc.'s, capital structure is 50% debt and 50% equity. ABC's cost of debt is 8%, while the cost of equity is 11%. ABC's corporate tax rate is 30%. Calculate the WACC for ABC.\n",

    "#### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "    WACC = [0.50 × 0.08 × (1 – 0.30)] + (0.50 × 0.11) = 0.083, or 8.3%\n",

    "### LOS 27.b: Explain factors affecting capital structure and the weighted-average cost of capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "Capital structures vary considerably among companies. Typically a company will target a capital structure that minimizes its WACC, while also considering the nature of its assets (i.e., long-lived or shorter-term) when choosing the duration of its financing sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may view factors that affect capital structures as those that determine a company's capacity to service debt. These factors may be internal or external to a firm. Internal factors include the characteristics of the business or industry, a company's life cycle stage, a company's existing debt level, and the corporate tax rate. External factors include market and business cycle conditions, regulation, and industry norms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Company characteristics that influence the proportion of debt in a company's capital structure include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Growth and stability of revenue.* High growth of revenue or stability of significant revenue suggest a continuing ability to service debt.\n",
    "* *Growth and predictability of cash flow.* Growing cash flow increases the ability to service debt. Significant and stable cash flows indicate a continuing ability to service debt.\n",
    "* *Amount of business risk.* More business risk (operational risk and demand risk) means greater variability of earnings and cash flows, which decreases the ability to service debt.\n",
    "* *Amount and liquidity of company assets.* Assets can be pledged as collateral to make a company's debt more attractive. When assets are more liquid (easier to turn into cash, values more stable), they can be pledged more readily.\n",
    "* *Cost and availability of debt financing.* Companies find debt relatively more attractive when the cost of debt is lower and investors are more willing to lend to the company. Both of these are greater when the characteristics just listed support the issuance of debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the more stable, predictable, and recurring are a company's revenues and cash flows, the higher proportion of debt it can have in its capital structure. With this in mind, we can say, other things equal:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Companies in noncyclical industries are better able to support high proportions of debt than companies in cyclical industries.\n",
    "* Companies with low fixed operating costs as a proportion of total costs (i.e., low operating leverage) are better able to support high proportions of debt than companies with high fixed costs.\n",
    "* Companies with subscription-based revenue models are better able to support high proportions of debt than companies with pay-per-use revenue models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The types of assets companies use to generate revenues also affect their ability to issue and service debt. For example, creditors tend to view tangible assets as better collateral than intangible assets, especially when those assets can be sold for cash, if necessary, without losing significant value (i.e., are more liquid) or are more readily substituted for similar assets (i.e., are more fungible). A company that owns its productive assets outright as opposed to using assets owned by others (such as a franchise model) has more collateral, which improves access to debt financing and reduces borrowing costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the types of assets, other issuer-specific conditions include the levels of existing debt and volatility of revenues and earnings. High levels of debt or high volatility of earnings indicates a lower ability to issue additional debt. Leverage (e.g., debt-to-equity or debt-to-operating profit) and coverage ratios e.g., \n",
    "\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "$\\text{interest coverage} = \\text{ EBIT / interest expense}$ \n",
    "\\\n",
    "are used for analyzing debt capacity.\n",
    "\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "We can see the effects of these various factors on the debt-to-equity ratios of companies at different stages of their company's life cycle. Consider the following three stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Start-up stage.* Sales are just beginning, and operating earnings and cash flows tend to be low or negative. Business risk is relatively high. Company debt is quite risky and, if issued, would require high interest rates. Assets, both accounts receivable and fixed assets, typically are low; therefore, they are not available as collateral for debt. For these reasons, start-up companies are financed almost exclusively with equity. In some cases, high-growth companies with rapidly rising stock prices may find it possible to issue **convertible debt**, which allows the company to use a lower-cost source of capital and avoid immediate dilution of existing shareholders' interests. Leasing assets is another source of debt financing available to companies in this stage of the life cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Growth stage.* Revenue and cash flow are rising, and business risk is somewhat reduced. Debt financing cost is somewhat reduced (i.e., usage is conservative), and investors may be willing to lend to the company, often with the loans secured by fixed assets or accounts receivable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Mature stage.* In this stage, revenue growth is slowing and business risk is much lower. Cash flow is significant and relatively stable. Debt financing, including unsecured debt, is widely available at a relatively low cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of capital is also influenced by top-down factors. Top-down factors are macroeconomic factors that affect the benchmark interest rate (e.g., U.S. Treasury rate) and credit spreads to benchmark rates. These include inflation, the real GDP growth rate, monetary policy, and exchange rates. In business cycle downturns, debt investors demand greater yield spreads to benchmark bonds from corporate borrowers to compensate them for the increased risk of default. This is especially true for companies in cyclical industries. Some industries may be favorably affected by the economic environment. For example, oil industry profitability is linked to oil prices, and spreads for issuers in the industry tend to narrow when oil prices rise.\n"
