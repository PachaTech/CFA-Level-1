    "A company's lenders (debtholders) have a legal, contractual claim to the interest and principal payments the company has promised to make. Owners (equity holders) have a residual claim to the company's net assets (i.e., what remains after all other claims have been paid). That is, lenders have a higher priority of claims than equity owners. Because debt is less risky than equity, it is a less costly form of capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both debtholders and equity holders can potentially lose their entire investment if a company fails, but their losses cannot exceed the amounts they have invested. A key difference between debt and equity investments is their upside potential. Regardless of a company's success, the best result debtholders can achieve is to receive the interest and principal payments promised by the company. Equity, on the other hand, has a theoretically unlimited upside if a company succeeds and grows over time.\n",

    "The value of a company is the sum of the value of its debt and the value of its equity. As the company's value increases (assuming its value is greater than the value of its debt), the value of equity increases with it, while the value of debt is constant (i.e., no upside for debt investors from company growth). If the value of a company is less than the value of its debt, the value of its equity is zero, and the value of its debt is below the promised amount and moves with the value of the company (i.e., debt has downside exposure)."

    "Because of the difference in their risk profiles, the interests of debtholders may conflict with the interests of equity holders. Debtholders are primarily concerned with a company's ability to repay its obligations and less concerned with its growth prospects. Equity holders may favor actions that increase a company's potential growth, but also increase its risk level, such as adding financial leverage by issuing new debt. Issuing additional debt as opposed to equity also prevents **dilution** of shareholders' proportional ownership. A company's existing debtholders may oppose such actions because increasing the company's risk (and the probability of defaulting on its debts) does not increase their expected return. Therefore, debt investors usually limit borrowers' actions by including contractual provisions such as maximum leverage or a minimum interest coverage ratio (known as covenants, which we will examine in the Fixed Income topic area) in debt agreements."

    "**Shareholders** have a *residual interest* in the corporation, in that they have claim to the net assets of the corporation after all liabilities have been settled. Shareholders have voting rights to elect the board of directors and for other important corporate matters, which gives them control over the firm and its management. They have an interest in ongoing profitability and growth of the firm that will increase the value of their ownership shares.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lenders** can be public or private debtholders. Public debtholders or **bondholders** supply debt capital to the firm and are primarily owners of the firm's outstanding bonds, while **private debtholders** such as banks extend loans, credit facilities, and leases to the firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Private debtholders may have access to nonpublic information from company management, which decreases information asymmetry. For this reason, private debtholders are a critical source of financing for small-to-medium-sized businesses. In some cases, private debtholders hold equity in the firm, allowing them to take a more equity-like approach to evaluating the company and potentially making them more amenable to changes in terms of the loans (i.e., covenants). By contrast, bondholders rely only on public information and have little to no influence over an issuer's operations. The interests of both types of lenders are protected to varying degrees by covenants in their debt agreements with the firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **board of directors** is responsible for protecting the interests of shareholders; hiring, firing, and setting the compensation of the firm's senior managers; establishing the strategic direction of the firm; and monitoring the company's financial performance and other aspects of its ongoing activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Board members include **inside directors** (e.g., senior executives, founders) and **independent directors** who have no material relationship with the company. While inside directors may have conflicts of interest with shareholders, independent directors may better protect shareholders' interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **one-tier board structure**, both inside and independent directors serve on a single board. Major stock exchanges specify requirements for director independence, such as that most of the board should comprise independent directors. Other requirements may include diversity of backgrounds and competencies. In continental Europe, boards have a **two-tier structure** in which the independent directors serve on a **supervisory board** that oversees a **management board** comprising inside directors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, board members are elected for a specified term (e.g., annual). In a **staggered board**, only a fraction of the board is elected each year. This decreases the power of shareholders to enact a major overhaul of the board. Firms with staggered boards justify them as providing continuity and allowing for a longer-term view of company strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Senior managers** typically receive compensation (remuneration) that is made up of a salary, a bonus based on some measure of company performance, and perks (e.g., expense accounts, use of company planes, special retirement benefits). Their interests can be expected to include continued employment and maximizing the total value of their compensation. Executive bonuses are typically tied to some measure of firm performance, giving senior managers a strong interest in the financial success of the firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other employees are the **human capital** of the company, who provide their labor and skills. Employees also have an interest in the sustainability and success of the firm. They have interests in their rate of pay, opportunities for career advancement, training, and working conditions. Employees may hold equity in the company by participating in employee stock participation plans, which are designed to align their interests with those of the shareholders of the company. In some industries, employees join unions to negotiate the terms of their employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suppliers** of resources to the firm have an interest in preserving an ongoing relationship with the firm, in the profitability of their trade with the firm, and in the growth and ongoing stability of the firm. Because suppliers are typically short-term creditors of the firm, they also have an interest in the firm's solvency and ongoing financial strength.\n",

Customers may also have an interest in preserving an ongoing relationship to receive support and after-sale service. Maintaining the good will of customers is critical for the long-term prospects of any company. Customers increasingly care about environmental and social responsibilities of corporations.\n",

    "Some debt and equity investors who take a stakeholder perspective are interested in evaluating companies' environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. This is primarily due to three reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Government stakeholders increasingly prioritize climate change and social policies through regulatory changes.\n",
    "2. ESG factors can have a material impact on companies' results through potential loss of customer good will and financial losses due to fines and judgments. Poor corporate governance may lead to senior managers exploiting shareholders to advance personal interests.\n",
    "3. Many younger investors increasingly manage their wealth with ESG considerations in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Negative externalities** arise when a company or its investors do not bear the full cost of its actions (e.g., environmental damage). Increased government regulations and stakeholder awareness necessitate companies to recognize these costs, either explicitly in their financial statements or implicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Environmental Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "Environmental factors include company contributions to problems such as climate change, air and water pollution, deforestation, energy efficiency, waste management, or water scarcity. Material environmental factors can have a substantial impact on companies' operations or business models. Industries that are natural resource intensive have a direct impact on the environment, but other industries may have indirect impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to climate change, companies may face **physical risk** of adverse effects on assets or operations if severe weather increases in frequency, as well as **transition risk** as government regulations or consumer choices require switching from high-carbon to low-carbon activities. **Stranded assets** are those that become unviable due to such changes. Poor safety policies or inadequate governance systems increase the risks for adverse events such as oil spills and contamination of groundwater. The costs of penalties, cleanup, litigation, and loss of reputation can be significant risks for a company's investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Social Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "Social factors include the protection of customer privacy and information security, customer satisfaction, employee engagement, diversity and inclusion, labor relations, and community relations. Social factors contribute to a company's image in terms of how it treats its employees, customers, and the communities in which it operates. Taking measures to decrease social risk can reduce a company's costs through higher employee productivity, lower turnover, increased customer loyalty, and less risk of litigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Governance\n",
    "\n",
    "Corporate governance encompasses factors such as the composition of the board and the internal audit committee, executive compensation, bribery and corruption, political contributions, and lobbying. Corporate governance systems should have adequate checks to ensure that managers act ethically, lawfully, and in the interests of shareholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation of ESG Risks\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysts should identify and measure the ESG-related risks to which a company may be exposed and how they can affect the company's future cash flows. Equity investors bear the brunt of the risk from adverse outcomes. Debt investors have less exposure to adverse events unless they result in losses large enough to bring about default. Not all debtholders are equally exposed to ESG risks. Because some such risks may be delayed (e.g., a coal-fired electricity plant that is currently in compliance may become obsolete in the future), longer-maturity debt investors may have more exposure than short-term debt investors.\n",
