    "In a market capitalization weighted index, the relative weight increases for constituent stocks that have outperformed other stocks in the index. For this reason, a market capitalization weighted index is an appropriate benchmark for a fund using a momentum strategy (buying securities that have been increasing in price and selling securities that have been decreasing in price). Fundamental weighted indices often have a value tilt, not a momentum tilt. With equal weighting there is no tilt toward momentum.\n",
