    "BamBam Inc. is a Canadian manufacturer of specialized machinery to produce pet food. BamBam exports its machinery to clients in many different countries. A recent transaction involves the sale of a machine to a client in France. The contract date is May 31st, the delivery date is 60 days later, and the client will make payment to BamBam in Euros. Which of the following reasons best explains why BamBam should use a derivative rather than a spot market transaction to manage the currency risk of the contract?\n",

    "**Explanation:** \\\n",
    "A 60-day timing difference exists between the contract and the delivery date when BamBam is paid for the machine in EUR. A derivative contract in which the underlying EUR/CAD forward rate is agreed upon today and exchanged on the delivery date allows BamBam to hedge or offset the CAD value of the future EUR payment. Therefore, the derivative is a more suitable contract to address the currency risk of the transaction than a spot market sale of EUR.\n",
