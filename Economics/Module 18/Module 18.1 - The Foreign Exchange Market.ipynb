An even larger market, however, exists for capital flows. Foreign currencies are needed to purchase foreign physical assets as well as foreign financial securities.\n",

    "Many companies have foreign exchange risk arising from their cross-border transactions. A Japanese company that expects to receive 10 million euros when a transaction is completed in 90 days has yen/euro exchange rate risk as a result. By entering into a **forward currency contract** to sell 10 million euros in 90 days for a specific quantity of yen, the firm can reduce or eliminate the foreign exchange risk associated with the transaction. When a firm takes a position in the foreign exchange market to reduce an existing risk, we say the firm is **hedging** its risk.\n",

    "In a foreign currency quotation, we have the price of one currency in units of another currency. These are often referred to as the **base currency** and the **price currency**. In the quotation 1.25 USD/EUR, the USD is the price currency and the EUR is the base currency. The price of one euro (base currency) is 1.25 USD (the price currency), so 1.25 is the price of one unit of the base currency in terms of the other. It may help to remember that the euro, in this example, is in the bottom or \"base\" of the exchange rate given in terms of USD/EUR.\n",
    "\n",
    "An exchange rate expressed as price currency/base currency is referred to as a **direct quote** from the point of view of an investor in the price currency country and an **indirect quote** from the point of view of an investor in the base currency country. For example, a quote of 1.17 USD/EUR would be a direct quote for a USD-based investor and an indirect quote for a EUR-based investor. Conversely, a quote of 1 / 1.17 = 0.855 EUR/USD would be a direct quote for a EUR-based investor and an indirect quote for a USD-based investor.\n",

    "The exchange rate at a point in time is referred to as a **nominal exchange rate**.

If the USD/EUR exchange rate increases from 1.10 to 1.15, the cost of 100 euros increases from \\\\$110 to \\\\$115. The purchasing power of the dollar has decreased relative to the euro because the cost of 100 euros' worth of goods to a consumer in the United States has increased over the period.\n",

With the nominal exchange rate unchanged, the purchasing power of the USD in the Eurozone has decreased, because exchanging 100 USD for 100 EUR will now buy only `100 / 105 = 95.2%` of the goods 100 EUR could buy at the beginning of the period.\n",

Using these exchange rates, we can calculate the change in the euro price of a dollar as `0.7194 / 0.7042 â€“ 1 = 0.0216 = 2.16%`. In this case, it is correct to say that the dollar has appreciated `2.16%` with respect to the euro.

    " **A currency board arrangement** is an explicit commitment to exchange domestic currency for a specified foreign currency at a fixed exchange rate. A notable example of such an arrangement is Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, currency is (and may be) only issued when fully backed by holdings of an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority can earn interest on its U.S. dollar balances. With dollarization, there is no such income, as the income is earned by the U.S. Federal Reserve when it buys interest-bearing assets with the U.S. currency it issues. While the monetary authority gives up the ability to conduct independent monetary policy and essentially imports the inflation rate of the outside currency, there may be some latitude to affect interest rates over the short term.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a  **conventional fixed peg arrangement**, a country pegs its currency within margins of Â±1% versus another currency or a basket that includes the currencies of its major trading or financial partners. The monetary authority can maintain exchange rates within the band by purchasing or selling foreign currencies in the foreign exchange markets (*direct intervention*). In addition, the country can use indirect intervention, including changes in interest rate policy, regulation of foreign exchange transactions, and convincing people to constrain foreign exchange activity. The monetary authority retains more flexibility to conduct monetary policy than with dollarization, a monetary union, or a currency board. However, changes in policy are constrained by the requirements of the peg.\n",

    "In a system of pegged exchange rates within horizontal bands or a **target zone**, the permitted fluctuations in currency value relative to another currency or basket of currencies are wider (e.g., Â±2%). Compared to a conventional peg, the monetary authority has more policy discretion because the bands are wider.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a **crawling peg**, the exchange rate is adjusted periodically, typically to adjust for higher inflation versus the currency used in the peg. This is termed a *passive crawling peg* as opposed to an *active crawling peg*, in which a series of exchange rate adjustments over time is announced and implemented. An active crawling peg can influence inflation expectations, adding some predictability to domestic inflation. Monetary policy is restricted in much the same way it is with a fixed peg arrangement.\n",

    "With **management of exchange rates** within crawling bands, the width of the bands that identify permissible exchange rates is increased over time. This method can be used to transition from a fixed peg to a floating rate when the monetary authority's lack of credibility makes an immediate change to floating rates impractical. Again, the degree of monetary policy flexibility increases with the width of the bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a system of **managed floating exchange rates**, the monetary authority attempts to influence the exchange rate in response to specific indicators such as the balance of payments, inflation rates, or employment without any specific target exchange rate or predetermined exchange rate path. Intervention may be direct or indirect. Such management of exchange rates may induce trading partners to respond in ways that reduce stability.\n",
    "\n",

    "Changes in exchange rates can affect both imports and exports. If the USD/EUR exchange rate decreases, the USD has appreciated relative to the EUR. In this case, the USD prices of imports from the Eurozone have decreased, and it takes more euros to purchase a U.S. good at the new exchange rate. As a result, Eurozone imports from the United States (U.S. exports to the Eurozone) will decrease, and U.S. imports of Eurozone goods (Eurozone exports to the United States) will increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effects on the goods market (imports and exports of merchandise) will occur more slowly than the effects on capital flows between countries. This is reflected in a country's **balance of payments**. Essentially, the balance of payments refers to the fact that capital flows must offset any imbalance between the value of a country's exports to and imports from another country.\n",

    "Consider two countries that have an imbalance between the value of their exports to and imports from another country, such as between China and the United States. Typically, U.S. imports from China have a greater value than U.S. exports to China. We say that the United States has a goods and services **trade deficit** with China and China has a **trade surplus** with the United States. Capital flows must offset this difference.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Capital flows result primarily from purchases of assets (both physical and financial) in one country by investors or governments in other countries. A large portion of the capital flows between the United States and China are purchases of U.S. debt securities by China. China has a **capital account deficit** that offsets its trade surplus with the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relation between the balance of trade and capital flows is expressed by the following identity, which was presented in the Economics prerequisite readings:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{(exports â€“ imports)} â‰¡ \\text{(private savings â€“ investment in physical capital)} \\ + \\text{(tax revenue â€“ government spending)}$\n",
    "\\\n",
    "or:\n",
    "\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "$(X-M) â‰¡ (S-I) + (T-G)$\n",
    "\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "or\n",
    "\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "$S + (T-G) < I$\n",
    "\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "The intuition is that a trade deficit $(X âˆ’ M < 0)$ means that the right-hand side must also be negative, which implies that total domestic savings (private savings + government savings) are less than domestic investment in physical capital. The additional amount to fund domestic investment must come from foreigners, which results in a surplus in the capital account to offset the deficit in the trade account. Another thing we can see from this identity is that any government deficit not funded by an excess of domestic saving over domestic investment is consistent with a trade deficit (imports > exports), which is offset by an inflow of foreign capital (a surplus in the capital account).\n",
    "\n",
    "Capital flows adjust more rapidly than spending, savings, and asset prices, so they are the primary determinant of exchange rates in the short and intermediate term. Trade flows are more important in determining exchange rates in the long term as asset prices and saving/investment decisions adjust over time."

    "### LOS 18.c: Describe common objectives of capital restrictions imposed by governments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Governments sometimes place restrictions on the flow of investment capital into their country, out of their country, or both. Commonly cited objectives of capital flow restrictions include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Reduce the volatility of domestic asset prices*. In times of macroeconomic crisis, capital flows out of the country can drive down asset prices drastically, especially with prices of liquid assets such as stocks and bonds. With no restrictions on inflows or outflows of foreign investment capital, the asset markets of countries with economies that are small relative to the amount of foreign investment can be quite volatile over a country's economic cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Maintain fixed exchange rates*. For countries with fixed exchange rate targets, limiting flows of foreign investment capital makes it easier to meet the exchange rate targetâ€”and, therefore, to be able to use monetary and fiscal policy to pursue only the economic goals for the domestic economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Keep domestic interest rates low*. By restricting the outflow of investment capital, countries can keep their domestic interest rates low and manage the domestic economy with monetary policy, as investors cannot pursue higher rates in foreign countries. China is an example of a country with a fixed exchange rate regime where restrictions on capital flows allow policymakers to maintain the target exchange rate as well as to pursue a monetary policy independent of concerns about its effect on currency exchange rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Protect strategic industries*. Governments sometimes prohibit investment by foreign entities in industries considered to be important for national security, such as the telecommunications and defense industries.\n",
