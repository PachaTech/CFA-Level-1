    "If a forward exchange rate does not correctly reflect the difference between the interest rates for two currencies, an arbitrage opportunity for a riskless profit exists. In this case, borrowing one currency, converting it to the other currency at the spot rate, investing the proceeds for the period, and converting the end-of-period amount back to the borrowed currency at the forward rate will produce more than enough to pay off the initial loan, with the remainder being a riskless profit on the arbitrage transaction.\n",
