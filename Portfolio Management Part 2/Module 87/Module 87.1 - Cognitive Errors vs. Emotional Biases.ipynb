Cognitive limitations and emotional responses introduce bias into the decision-making process, leading to decisions that are biased (not perfectly rational). Behavioral finance asserts that certain biases, which are not simply random errors, are widespread and therefore predictable.\n",

    "Psychologists use the term **cognitive dissonance** to refer to a situation where an individual holds conflicting beliefs or receives information that causes a current belief to be questioned. Cognitive dissonance causes stress that individuals seek to reduce. They may do so by letting go of prior beliefs in favor of the conflicting belief. On the other hand, they might discount the conflicting information or viewpoints by questioning their truth, source, applicability, or significance. To the extent that it is easier to do the latter than the former, bias in favor of currently held beliefs is the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Conservatism bias** occurs when market participants rationally form an initial view but then fail to change that view as new information becomes available. That is, they overweight their prior probabilities and do not adjust them appropriately as new information becomes available. Individuals displaying this bias tend to maintain prior forecasts and securities allocations, ignoring or failing to recognize the significance of new information. Individuals may react slowly to new data or ignore information that is complex to process.\n",

Consider this example of base-rate neglect: a group was asked to identify the most likely occupation of a man who was characterized as somewhat shy as a salesperson or a librarian. Most participants chose librarian, thinking that most librarians would tend to be more shy on average than salespeople, who tend to be outgoing. Their mistake was in not considering that there are relatively few male librarians and a great number of male salespeople. Even though a greater percentage of librarians may be characterized as somewhat shy, the absolute number of salespeople who could be characterized as somewhat shy is significantly greater.\n",

    "**Anchoring and adjustment bias** refers to basing expectations on a prior number and overweighting its importance, making adjustments in relation to that number as new information arrives. Examples would be estimating the value of a security relative to its current value or making estimates of earnings per share relative to a previously reported value or relative to a prior estimate. Anchoring leads to underestimating the implications of new information. New data should be considered objectively without regard to any initial anchor point.\n",

    "**Mental accounting bias** refers to viewing money in different accounts or from different sources differently when making investment decisions. This conflicts with the idea that security decisions should be made in the context of the investor's overall portfolio of assets based on their financial goals and risk tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of mental accounting is an investor who receives an unexpected bonus at work and chooses to invest it in a very risky biotechnology stock, reasoning that the bonus is \"found money\" that can acceptably be risked on speculation. In fact, while such a stock may have a place in the investor's portfolio, decisions about whether and how much of it to include should be based on a total portfolio approach. Another example may be an investor who receives an inheritance from a parent and segregates those funds into low-risk bonds out of a desire to \"not lose any of the money the parent worked so hard to save.\" This behavior also conflicts with the principle that investments should be considered in the context of the entire portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of such mental accounting may be that an investor's overall portfolio is not optimal given the investor's circumstances, investment goals, and risk tolerance. It can cause an investor to hold positions that offset each other, rather than considering investments in the context of their correlation of returns. One common form of mental accounting bias is a tendency to view income differently from capital appreciation. This may cause an investor to hold a mix of income-producing and non-income-producing securities that does not match the investor's circumstances.\n",

It appears that New York taxi drivers have a reference rate for daily income and perceive a loss if they fail to meet it (which we may also view as an example of anchoring). On rainy days, demand for taxis is high, while on sunny days, the demand is low. Logically, you would expect taxi drivers to work more hours on rainy days to maximize their incomes. In reality, the opposite was true. Taxi drivers worked longer hours on sunny days as they strove to hit their target income.

Availability bias occurs when individuals judge the probability of an event occurring by the ease with which examples and instances come to mind. By the very nature of memory, more-recent events are typically easier to recall than events further in the past, which leads to the bias of attaching too much significance to events that have occurred recently and too little to events that occurred further in the past.

Their sense of regret and pain is stronger for acts of commission. This is quite similar to status quo bias.\n",

    "### LOS 87.c: Describe how behavioral biases of investors can lead to market characteristics that may not be explained by traditional finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our Equity Investments reading on Market Efficiency, we developed the ideas of anomalies (results that do not fit the prevailing model of securities risks and returns) and market inefficiencies (anomalies that present opportunities to earn positive risk-adjusted returns). Many market anomalies have been explained by small sample size, time period bias, or inadequacies in the specification of prevailing models of returns. In the same way, some anomalies once considered evidence of market inefficiency have been explained by the possible misspecification of risk, leading to inaccurate risk adjustment of returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bubbles and subsequent crashes have been with us as long as trading markets have existed. Some have offered explanations for these extremes of valuation based on rational behavior. Investors who leave markets that they determine are exhibiting characteristics of a bubble may miss out on high returns over extended periods. On the other hand, investors who stay invested based on a belief that they will be able to get out at or near the market top often find that that is not realistic. Either type of mistake, leaving the market too early or staying fully invested too long, can be quite damaging to a fund manager's career. Exploiting the fact that a market is \"in a bubble\" for an arbitrage profit may not be possible due to the restrictions on and risk of short selling in a rapidly rising market.\n",
    "\n",
    "While behavioral finance does not provide an overall explanation for bubbles and their aftermath, some have claimed that cognitive and emotional biases exhibited during such periods may have some causal effects. These claims include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Overconfidence* may lead to overtrading, underestimation of risk, and lack of diversification.\n",
    "* Persistently good results combined with *self-attribution bias* can fuel overconfidence, as can *hindsight bias* (as investors give themselves credit for choosing profitable stocks in a bull market).\n",
    "* *Confirmation bias* may lead investors to ignore or misinterpret new information suggesting that valuations will not continue to rise, or to misinterpret initial decreases in asset values as simply another buying opportunity.\n",
    "* *Anchoring* may cause investors to believe recent highs are rational prices even after prices begin their eventual decline.\n",
    "* Fear of *regret* may keep even very skeptical investors in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "One anomaly that has been persistent over time is the value/growth anomaly. Value stocks (low market-book, low P/E, high dividend yield stocks) have outperformed growth stocks (high P/E, low dividend yield stocks) over long periods. Fama and French (1992) found that adding risk factors for firm size and book-to-market ratio to a model of stock returns eliminated the evidence of value stock outperformance. These results suggest that the extra returns to value stocks were compensation for additional risks captured by firm size and book-to-market ratios.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Others have suggested behavioral factors as the cause of the seeming outperformance of value stocks. The **halo effect** is a version of representativeness in which a company's good characteristics, such as fast growth and a rising stock price, are extended into a conclusion that it is a good stock to own, leading to overvaluation of growth stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that investors tend to invest heavily in firms in their domestic country in a global portfolio, or more heavily in firms operating in their region of a country, is considered anomalous in that rationality suggests greater diversification. Such **home bias**, it is claimed, may result from a belief that they have better access to information or simply an emotional desire to invest in companies \"closer to home.\" Similarly, investors may underestimate the risk or overestimate the future returns of firms whose products they use or firms for which they are exposed to a great amount of positive marketing messages.\n",
