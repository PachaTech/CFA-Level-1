    "\n",
    "The **portfolio perspective** refers to evaluating individual investments by their contribution to the risk and return of an investor's portfolio. The alternative to taking a portfolio perspective is to examine the risk and return of individual investments in isolation. An investor who holds all his wealth in a single stock because he believes it to be the best stock available is not taking the portfolio perspective—his portfolio is very risky compared to holding a diversified portfolio of stocks. Modern portfolio theory concludes that the extra risk from holding only a single security is not rewarded with higher expected investment returns. Conversely, diversification allows an investor to reduce portfolio risk without necessarily reducing the portfolio's expected return.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early 1950s, the research of Professor Harry Markowitz provided a framework for measuring the risk-reduction benefits of diversification. Using the standard deviation of returns as the measure of investment risk, he investigated how combining risky securities into a portfolio affected the portfolio's risk and expected return. One important conclusion of his model is that unless the returns of the risky assets are perfectly positively correlated, risk is reduced by diversifying across assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1960s, professors Treynor, Sharpe, Mossin, and Lintner independently extended this work into what has become known as modern portfolio theory (MPT). MPT results in equilibrium expected returns for securities and portfolios that are a linear function of each security's or portfolio's market risk (the risk that cannot be reduced by diversification).\n",
    "\n",
    "One measure of the benefits of diversification is the diversification ratio. It is calculated as the ratio of the risk of an equally weighted portfolio of n securities (measured by its standard deviation of returns) to the risk of a single security selected at random from the n securities. If the average standard deviation of returns for the n stocks is 25%, and the standard deviation of returns for an equally weighted portfolio of the $n$ stocks is 18%, the diversification ratio is `18 / 25 = 0.72`. If the standard deviation of returns for an equally weighted portfolio is 25%, there are no diversification benefits and the diversification ratio equals one. A lower diversification ratio indicates a greater risk-reduction benefit from diversification.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the **diversification ratio** provides a quick measure of the potential benefits of diversification, an equal-weighted portfolio is not necessarily the portfolio that provides the greatest reduction in risk. Computer optimization can calculate the portfolio weights that will produce the lowest portfolio risk (standard deviation of returns) for a given group of securities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Portfolio diversification works best when financial markets are operating normally; diversification provides less reduction of risk during market turmoil, such as the credit contagion of 2008. During periods of financial crisis, correlations tend to increase, which reduces the benefits of diversification."

    "\n",
    "There are three major steps in the portfolio management process:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **planning step** begins with an analysis of the investor's risk tolerance, return objectives, time horizon, tax exposure, liquidity needs, income needs, and any unique circumstances or investor preferences.  Understand client!  \n",
    "\n",
    "    This analysis results in a formal document called the **investment policy statement (IPS)** that details the investor's investment objectives and constraints. It should also specify an objective benchmark (such as an index return) against which the success of the portfolio management process will be measured. The IPS should be updated at least every few years and any time the investor's objectives or constraints change significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **execution step** involves an analysis of the risk and return characteristics of various asset classes to determine how funds will be allocated to the various asset types. Often, in what is referred to as a (top-down analysis), a portfolio manager will examine current economic conditions and forecasts of such macroeconomic variables as GDP growth, inflation, and interest rates, in order to identify the asset classes that are most attractive. The resulting portfolio is typically diversified across such asset classes as cash, fixed-income securities, publicly traded equities, hedge funds, private equity, and real estate, as well as commodities and other real assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Once the asset class allocations are determined, portfolio managers may attempt to identify the most attractive securities within the asset class. Security analysts use model valuations for securities to identify those that appear undervalued in what is termed (bottom-up) security analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **feedback step** is the final step. Over time, investor circumstances will change, risk and return characteristics of asset classes will change, and the actual weights of the assets in the portfolio will change with asset prices. The portfolio manager must monitor these changes and **rebalance** the portfolio periodically in response, adjusting the allocations to the various asset classes back to their desired percentages. The manager must also measure portfolio performance and evaluate it relative to the return on the benchmark portfolio identified in the IPS."

    "**Individual investors** save and invest for a variety of reasons, including purchasing a house or educating their children. In many countries, special accounts allow citizens to invest for retirement and to defer any taxes on investment income and gains until the funds are withdrawn. Defined contribution pension plans are popular vehicles for these investments. Pension plans are described later in this reading.\n",

    "Many types of **institutions** have large investment portfolios. An **endowment** is a fund that is dedicated to providing financial support on an ongoing basis for a specific purpose. For example, in the United States, many universities have large endowment funds to support their programs. A **foundation** is a fund established for charitable purposes to support specific types of activities or to fund research related to a particular disease. A typical foundation's investment objective is to fund the activity or research on a continuing basis without decreasing the real (inflation adjusted) value of the portfolio assets. Foundations and endowments typically have long investment horizons, high risk tolerance, and, aside from their planned spending needs, little need for additional liquidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The investment objective of a **bank**, simply put, is to earn more on the bank's loans and investments than the bank pays for deposits of various types. Banks seek to keep risk low and need adequate liquidity to meet investor withdrawals as they occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insurance companies** invest customer premiums with the objective of funding customer claims as they occur. Life insurance companies have a relatively long-term investment horizon, while property and casualty (P&C) insurers have a shorter investment horizon because claims are expected to arise sooner than for life insurers.\n",

    "### LOS 85.e: Describe aspects of the asset management industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The asset management industry comprises firms that manage investments for clients. Asset management firms include both independent managers and divisions of larger financial services companies. They are referred to as **buy-side firms**, in contrast with **sell-side firms** such as broker-dealers and investment banks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Full-service asset managers** are those that offer a variety of investment styles and asset classes. **Specialist asset managers** may focus on a particular investment style or a particular asset class. A **multi-boutique firm** is a holding company that includes a number of different specialist asset managers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key distinction is between firms that use active management and those that use passive management. **Active management** attempts to outperform a chosen benchmark through manager skill, for example by using fundamental or technical analysis. **Passive management** attempts to replicate the performance of a chosen benchmark index. This may include traditional broad market index tracking or a smart beta approach that focuses on exposure to a particular market risk factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Passive management represents about one-fifth of assets under management. Its share of industry revenue is even smaller because fees for passive management are lower than fees for active management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asset management firms may also be classified as traditional or alternative, based on the asset classes they manage. Traditional asset managers focus on equities and fixed-income securities. Alternative asset managers focus on asset classes such as private equity, hedge funds, real estate, or commodities. Profit margins tend to be higher for the alternative asset classes. As a result, many traditional asset managers have been moving into this area, somewhat blurring the distinction between these types of firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some trends in the asset management industry are worth noting:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The market share for passive management has been growing over time. This is due in part to the lower fees passive managers charge investors, and in part to questions about whether active managers are actually able to add value over time on a risk-adjusted basis, especially in developed markets that are believed to be relatively efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The amount of data available to asset managers has grown exponentially in recent years. This has encouraged them to invest in information technology and third-party services to process these data, attempting to capitalize on information quickly to make investment decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Robo-advisors** are a technology that can offer investors advice and recommendations based on their investment requirements and constraints, using a computer algorithm. These advisors increasingly appeal to younger investors and those with smaller portfolios than have typically been served by asset management firms. They have also lowered the barriers to entry into the asset management industry for firms such as insurance companies."

    "### LOS 85.f: Describe mutual funds and compare them with other pooled investment products.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mutual funds** are one form of **pooled investments** (i.e., a single portfolio that contains investment funds from multiple investors). Each investor owns shares representing ownership of a portion of the overall portfolio. The total net value of the assets in the fund (pool) divided by the number of such shares issued is referred to as the **net asset value (NAV)** of each share.\n",
    "\n",
    "With an **open-end fund**, investors can buy newly issued shares at the NAV. Newly invested cash is invested by the mutual fund managers in additional portfolio securities. Investors can **redeem** their shares (sell them back to the fund) at NAV as well. All mutual funds charge a fee for the ongoing management of the portfolio assets, which is expressed as a percentage of the net asset value of the fund. **No-load funds** do not charge additional fees for purchasing shares (up-front fees) or for redeeming shares (redemption fees). **Load funds** charge either up-front fees, redemption fees, or both.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Closed-end funds** are professionally managed pools of investor money that do not take new investments into the fund or redeem investor shares. The shares of a closed-end fund trade like equity shares (on exchanges or over-the-counter). As with open-end funds, the portfolio management firm charges ongoing management fees."

    "**Money market funds** invest in short-term debt securities and provide interest income with very low risk of changes in share value. Fund NAVs are typically set to one currency unit, but there have been instances over recent years in which the NAV of some funds declined when the securities they held dropped dramatically in value. Funds are differentiated by the types of money market securities they purchase and their average maturities.\n",

    "**Bond mutual funds** invest in fixed-income securities. They are differentiated by bond maturities, credit ratings, issuers, and types. Examples include government bond funds, tax-exempt bond funds, high-yield (lower rated corporate) bond funds, and global bond funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "A great variety of **stock mutual funds** are available to investors. **Index funds** are **passively managed**; that is, the portfolio is constructed to match the performance of a particular index, such as the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. **Actively managed** funds refer to funds where the management selects individual securities with the goal of producing returns greater than those of their benchmark indexes. Annual management fees are higher for actively managed funds, and actively managed funds have higher turnover of portfolio securities (the percentage of investments that are changed during the year). This leads to greater tax liabilities compared to passively managed index funds."

    "**Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)** are similar to closed-end funds in that purchases and sales are made in the market rather than with the fund itself. There are important differences, however. While closed-end funds are often actively managed, ETFs are most often invested to match a particular index (passively managed). With closed-end funds, the market price of shares can differ significantly from their NAV due to imbalances between investor supply and demand for shares at any point in time. Special redemption provisions for ETFs are designed to keep their market prices very close to their NAVs.\n",
    "\n",
    "ETFs can be sold short, purchased on margin, and traded at intraday prices, whereas open-end funds are typically sold and redeemed only daily, based on the share NAV calculated with closing asset prices. Investors in ETFs must pay brokerage commissions when they trade, and there is a spread between the bid price at which market makers will buy shares and the ask price at which market makers will sell shares. With most ETFs, investors receive any dividend income on portfolio stocks in cash, while open-end funds offer the alternative of reinvesting dividends in additional fund shares. One final difference is that ETFs may produce less capital gains liability compared to open-end index funds. This is because investor sales of ETF shares do not require the fund to sell any securities. If an open-end fund has significant redemptions that cause it to sell appreciated portfolio shares, shareholders incur a capital gains tax liability.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **separately managed account** is a portfolio that is owned by a single investor and managed according to that investor's needs and preferences. No shares are issued, as the single investor owns the entire account.\n",

    "**Hedge funds** are pools of investor funds that are not regulated to the extent that mutual funds are. Hedge funds are limited in the number of investors who can invest in the fund and are often sold only to qualified investors who have a minimum amount of overall portfolio wealth. Minimum investments can be quite high, often between \\\\$250,000 and \\\\$1 million.\n",
