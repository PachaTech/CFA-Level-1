The first number represents the future period in which the loan begins, and the second denotes the length of the loan. Hence, 2y1y is the rate for a 1-year loan to be made two years from now; 3y2y is the 2-year forward rate three years from now; 1y1y is the rate for a 1-year loan one year from now; and so on.\n",

    "### LOS 57.c: Compare the spot curve, par curve, and forward curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spot rate yield curve (spot curve) for U.S. Treasury bonds, also referred to as the zero curve or the strip curve (because zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bonds are also called stripped Treasuries), is a plot of spot rates versus maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, a spot curve is upward sloping, with higher spot rates for longer maturities (referred to as a normal yield curve), reflecting investor demand for higher returns over longer time frames. When spot rates are lower for longer-dated maturities, the spot curve is downward-sloping and is said to be inverted. Spot rates are usually quoted on a semiannual bond basis, so they are directly comparable to YTMs quoted for coupon government bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **yield curve for coupon bonds** shows the YTMs for a similar type of actively traded coupon bonds at various maturities (e.g., U.S. Treasury bonds). Yields are calculated for several available maturities, and yields for bonds with maturities between these are estimated by linear interpolation. Yields are usually expressed on a semiannual bond basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "A practical issue with constructing yield curves directly from traded coupon bond prices is that distortions in yields can occur due to illiquidity and taxation differences between interest income and gains and losses from buying bonds at a discount or premium. To avoid the illiquidity issue, \"on-the-run\" (most recently issued) bond yields are used; however, there may not be enough on-the-run securities to construct a meaningful curve, and the ones that do exist may trade at a premium or discount to par, causing taxation distortions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid these practical issues when constructing a coupon bond yield curve, a **par bond yield curve**, or *par curve*, can be constructed from spot curves. As we discussed earlier, par yields are hypothetical yields of bonds that would trade at par for a specific maturity. A par yield curve displays the yields of par bonds versus maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **forward yield curve** shows forward rates for bonds or money market securities for annual periods in the future. Typically, the forward curve would show the yields of 1-year securities for each future year, quoted on a semiannual bond basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen, the spot rate for a given maturity is a geometric average of the forward rates that apply to each period between now and that maturity. Therefore, when the forward curve is upward sloping, the spot curve is also upward sloping, but less so. We also saw earlier how a par yield at a certain maturity is a weighted average of the spot rates that apply to the individual cash flows of the bond (most heavily weighted toward the longest-dated spot rate when par payment takes place). Hence, par yields will also be upward sloping, and very close to spot rates (but slightly below them) in a normal (upward-sloping) forward curve environment.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Professor's Note**\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "It might be helpful, once again, to approximate using simple averages to \n",
    "get a clear picture. Assume the 1-year spot rate is 1% and the 1y1y forward rate is 3%. \n",
    "Note that we have rising periodic rates here (the forward curve is rising with maturity). \n",
    "The annualized 2-year spot is approximated as (1% + 3%) / 2 = 2%, so we can see the spot curve \n",
    "is also rising with maturity, but at a slower pace than forward rates. \n",
    "\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "The yield of a 1-year annual coupon bond would be 1% because there would only be one cash flow at maturity for this bond, and it would therefore earn the 1-year spot rate. The 2-year yield would be a weighted average of the 1-year spot of 1% and the 2-year spot of 2%, but mostly 2% because that is where most of the 2-year bond's cash flows occur. So, we can see that par yields, too, are rising with maturity—and are close to, but slightly below, spot rates. The key takeaway here is that forward rates drive spot rates, which in turn drive par yields.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, when the forward curve is downward sloping, the spot curve will also be downward sloping, but less so; and par yields will also be downward sloping, and close to spot rates (but slightly above them). One potential explanation for an inverted yield curve is that interest rates are expected to decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "When forward rates are constant, it means that all future periodic rates are the same. This means that spot rates to all maturities will be the same—and therefore, bond yields will be the same for all maturities. We describe this as a flat yield curve environment."
