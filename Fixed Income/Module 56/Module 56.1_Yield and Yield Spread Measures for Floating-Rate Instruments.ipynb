    "### Floating-Rate Note Yields\n",
    "\n",
    "The values of <u>floating-rate notes (FRNs)</u> are more stable than those of fixed-rate debt of similar maturity because the coupon rate is reset periodically based on a variable market reference rate `(MRR) = LIBOR or SOFR or Fed Funds Rate`. Recall that the coupon rate on an FRN consists of a relatively risk-free (usually interbank) MRR plus a **fixed margin** based on the credit risk of the issuer (at the time of issuance) relative to the credit risk of the MRR. The `fixed margin` is kind of like the `coupon` that is payed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coupon rate for the next period is set using the current MRR for the reset period, and the payment at the end of the period is based on this rate. For this reason, we say that interest is paid in *arrears*.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an FRN is issued by a company that has more (less) credit risk than the financial institutions from which the MRR is derived, a margin is added to (subtracted from) the MRR. The liquidity of an FRN and its tax treatment can also affect the margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fixed margin above the MRR actually paid in the coupon is referred to as the **quoted margin (QM)**. The margin required to price the FRN at par is called the **required margin** or the **discount margin (DM)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "FRNs are usually issued at par with the QM equal to the DM at issuance. If the credit quality of an FRN remains unchanged after issuance, the QM will remain equal to the DM and the FRN will trade at par on its coupon reset dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the credit quality of the issuer decreases after issuance of the FRN, investors will demand a higher DM in compensation for increased credit risk. This will cause the DM to be greater than the fixed QM, and the FRN will trade at a discount to its par value. Similarly, if the issuer's credit quality improves during an FRN's life, the DM will be less than the fixed QM, and the FRN will sell at a premium to its par value.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Professor's Note**  \n",
    "This is analogous to the relationship between the coupon and yield for fixed-coupon instruments. If investors demand more yield from a fixed-coupon bond than the regular coupon, then the coupon is said to be deficient, and the bond trades at a discount to par. With an FRN, the bond pays a coupon of `MRR + QM` and investors demand a yield of `MRR + DM`. When the `MRR + DM` is greater than `MRR + QM`, the `QM` is deficient and the FRN will trade below par.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simplified way of calculating the value of an FRN on a reset date is to use the current MRR plus the QM to estimate the future cash flows for the FRN, and discount these future cash flows at the MRR + DM. More complex models produce better estimates of value.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Valuation of an FRN**\n",
    "\n",
    "A \\\\$100,000 FRN with a semiannual coupon pays a 180-day MRR plus a quoted margin of 120 basis points. On a reset date with five years remaining to maturity, the 180-day MRR is quoted as 3.0\\% (annualized), and the discount margin (based on the issuer's current credit rating) is 1.5\\% (annualized). Estimate the value of the FRN."

    "For money market securities (debt securities maturing in a year or less), yields are quoted using various conventions. Some yield quotes are based on a 360-day year, while others are based on a 365-day year. Some yield quotes are add-on yields, and others are discount yields. Add-on yields are simply the interest to be earned on the amount paid or deposited today. Discount yields are annualized current discounts from the face values of money market securities received at maturity.\n",

    "The relation between a security's yield quoted as an annualized add-on yield based on a 365-day year and its holding period yield (HPY) is as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "The relation between a quoted discount and the actual unannualized discount based on a 360-day year is as follows:\n",

The discount (required) margin (DM) is the required return on the note for it to be priced at par. If the DM is greater than the QM, this means that investors are requiring a higher yield than currently being offered, causing the note to trade below par.\n",
