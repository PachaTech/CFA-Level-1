    "\n",
    "We must say usually because there are instances where an increase in a discount coupon bond's maturity will decrease its Macaulay duration. For a discount bond, duration first increases with longer maturity and then decreases over a range of relatively long maturities until it approaches the duration of a perpetuity, which is `(1 + YTM) / YTM`.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Other things equal, a *higher coupon rate* on a bond will decrease its interest rate risk. For a given maturity and YTM, the duration of a zero-coupon bond will be greater than that of a coupon bond. Increasing the coupon rate means more of a bond's value will be from payments received sooner, so that the value of the bond will be less sensitive to changes in yield.\n",
    "\n",
    "For floating-rate notes (FRNs) where coupons are periodically reset to a market reference rate (MRR), when interest rates rise, the coupon will also rise, limiting the price risk of the bond. Macaulay duration for an FRN can be calculated as the time to the next coupon reset date at the end of the current coupon period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other things equal, an *increase (decrease)* in a bond's YTM will decrease (increase) its interest rate risk. To understand this, we can look to the convexity of the price-yield curve and use its slope as our proxy for interest rate risk. At lower yields, the price-yield curve has a steeper slope, indicating that price is more sensitive to a given change in yield."
