    "In our reading on Yield-Based Bond Duration Measures and Properties, we showed that modified duration is a linear approximation of the price-yield relationship. Because the true relationship is convex, duration-based estimates of a bond's full price will be increasingly different from actual prices as we increase the changes in yield. This is illustrated in  Price-Yield Curve for an Option-Free, 8%, 20-Year **Semiannual-Pay Bond**. Duration-based price estimates for a decrease and for an increase in YTM are shown as Est.â€“ and Est.+.\n",
